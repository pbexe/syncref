abstract = {Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a sensitive method for investigating the biochemical compounds in a tissue. The interpretation of the data relies on the quantification algorithms applied to MR spectra. Each of these algorithms has certain underlying assumptions and may allow one to incorporate prior knowledge, which could influence the quality of the fit. The most commonly considered types of prior knowledge include the line-shape model (Lorentzian, Gaussian, Voigt), knowledge of the resonating frequencies, modeling of the baseline, constraints on the damping factors and phase, etc. In this article, we study whether the statistical outcome of a biological investigation can be influenced by the quantification method used. We chose to study lipid signals because of their emerging role in the investigation of metabolic disorders. Lipid spectra, in particular, are characterized by peaks that are in most cases not Lorentzian, because measurements are often performed in difficult body locations, e.g. in visceral fats close to peristaltic movements in humans or very small areas close to different tissues in animals. This leads to spectra with several peak distortions. Linear combination of Model spectra (LCModel), Advanced Method for Accurate Robust and Efficient Spectral fitting (AMARES), quantitation based on QUantum ESTimation (QUEST), Automated Quantification of Short Echo-time MRS (AQSES)-Lineshape and Integration were applied to simulated spectra, and area under the curve (AUC) values, which are proportional to the quantity of the resonating molecules in the tissue, were compared with true values. A comparison between techniques was also carried out on lipid signals from obese and lean Zucker rats, for which the polyunsaturation value expressed in white adipose tissue should be statistically different, as confirmed by high-resolution NMR measurements (considered the gold standard) on the same animals. LCModel, AQSES-Lineshape, QUEST and Integration gave the best results in at least one of the considered groups of simulated or in vivo lipid signals. These outcomes highlight the fact that quantification methods can influence the final result and its statistical significance. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Lloyd1996a,
abstract = {We propose a quantum algorithm that emulates the action of an unknown unitary transformation on a given input state, using multiple copies of some unknown sample input states of the unitary and their corresponding output states. The algorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be emulated, or the sample input states. To emulate the action of the unknown unitary, the new input state is coupled to the given sample input-output pairs in a coherent fashion. Remarkably, the runtime of the algorithm is logarithmic in D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d, the dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore, the sample complexity of the algorithm, i.e. the total number of copies of the sample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm, is independent of D, and polynomial in d. In contrast, the runtime and the sample complexity of incoherent methods, i.e. methods that use tomography, are both linear in D. The algorithm is blind, in the sense that at the end it does not learn anything about the given samples, or the emulated unitary. This algorithm can be used as a subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation.},

abstract = {— Propagation of information encoded in spin de-grees of freedom through networks of coupled spins enables important applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. We study control of information propagation in rings of 1 2 -spins with uniform nearest neighbour couplings forming a ring with a single excitation in the network as simple prototype of a router for spin-based information. Specifically optimising spatially distributed potentials, which remain con-stant during information transfer, simplifies the implementation of the routing scheme. However, the limited degrees of freedom makes finding a control that maximises the transfer probability in a short time difficult. The structure of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors must fulfill a specific condition to be able to maximise the transfer fidelity. While there are many potential structures that fulfill this condition, we choose a specific one, which in turn significantly improves the solutions found by optimal control.},

@article{Mathew2009,
abstract = {Multiple quantum coherences provide a powerful approach for studies of complex systems because increasing the number of quantum states in a quantum mechanical superposition state increases the selectivity of a spectroscopic measurement. We show that frequency domain multiple quantum coherence multidimensional spectroscopy can create these superposition states using different frequency excitation pulses. The superposition state is created using two excitation frequencies to excite the symmetric and asymmetric stretch modes in a rhodium dicarbonyl chelate and the dynamic Stark effect to climb the vibrational ladders involving different overtone and combination band states. A monochromator resolves the free induction decay of different coherences comprising the superposition state. The three spectral dimensions provide the selectivity required to observe 19 different spectral features associated with fully coherent nonlinear processes involving up to 11 interactions with the excitation fields. The different features act as spectroscopic probes of the diagonal and off-diagonal parts of the molecular potential energy hypersurface. This approach can be considered as a coherent pump-probe spectroscopy where the pump is a series of excitation pulses that prepares a multiple quantum coherence and the probe is another series of pulses that creates the output coherence.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.},

@article{Ohliger2006,
abstract = {The basic principles of radiofrequency coil array design for parallel MRI are described from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Because parallel MRI techniques rely on coil array sensitivities to provide spatial information about the sample, a careful choice of array design is essential. The concepts of coil array spatial encoding are first discussed from four qualitative perspectives. These qualitative descriptions include using coil arrays to emulate spatial harmonics, choosing coils with selective sensitivities to aliased pixels, using coil sensitivities with broad k-space reception profiles, and relying on detector coils to provide a set of generalized projections of the sample. This qualitative discussion is followed by a quantitative analysis of coil arrays, which is discussed in terms of the baseline SNR of the received images as well as the noise amplifications (g-factor) in the reconstructed data. The complications encountered during the experimental evaluation of coil array SNR are discussed, and solutions are proposed. A series of specific array designs are reviewed, with an emphasis on the general design considerations that motivate each approach. Finally, a set of special topics is discussed, which reflect issues that have become important, especially as arrays are being designed for more high-performance applications of parallel MRI. These topics include concerns about the depth penetration of arrays composed of small elements, the use of adaptive arrays for systems with limited receiver channels, the management of inductive coupling between array elements, and special considerations required at high field strengths. The fundamental limits of spatial encoding using coil arrays are discussed, with a primary emphasis on how the determination of these limits impacts the design of optimized arrays. This review is intended to provide insight into how arrays are currently used for parallel MRI and to place into context the new innovations that are to come.

However, investigation of this hypothesis is limited by difficulty obtaining noninvasive in vivo measures of brain GABA levels. In this study we used in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the hypothesis that abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmitter system are associated with the neurobiologic processes of depression. Methods: The GABA levels were measured in the occipital cortex of medication-free depressed patients meeting DSM-IV criteria (n = 14) and healthy control subjects with no history of mental illness (n = 18) using a localized difference editing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy protocol. An analysis of covariance was employed to examine the effects of depression, sex, and age. Results: The depressed patients demonstrated a highly significant (52{\%}) reduction in occipital cortex GABA levels compared with the group of healthy subjects. While there were significant age and sex effects, there was no interaction of diagnosis with either age or sex. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence of abnormally low cortical GABA concentrations in the brains of depressed patients.},

We therefore systematically reviewed whether in vivo concentrations of glutamate, glutamine and Glx measured with 1H-MRS differ between MDD patients and controls. Meta-analysis including meta-regression, sensitivity, statistical heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses were conducted. Glutamate and Glx concentrations were found to be lower in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients compared to controls (standardized mean difference (SMD) for glutamate with 95{\%} CIs: -0.86, -1.55 to -0.17; and for Glx: -1.15, -1.86 to -0.44). In addition, Glx was decreased in all brain regions together in current episode patients (SMD: -0.62, -1.17 to -0.07). We conclude that in MDD, glutamate and possibly glutamine are downregulated primarily in the ACC and during depressive states. These results fit the central role of the ACC in depressive symptomatology and suggest that in MDD changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission are state-dependent. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) single bounce micro-attenuated total reflectance (mATR) spectroscopy, combined with multivariate and artificial neural network (ANN) data analysis, was used to determine the adulteration of industrial grade glycerol in selected red wines. Red wine samples were artificially adulterated with industrial grade glycerol over the concentration range from 0.1 to 15{\%} and calibration models were developed and validated. Single bounce infrared spectra of glycerol adulterated wine samples were recorded in the fingerprint mid-infrared region, 900-1500 cm(-1). Partial least squares (PLS) and PLS first derivatives were used for quantitative analysis (r2 = 0.945 to 0.998), while linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA) were used for classification and discrimination. The standard error of prediction (SEP) in the validation set was between 1.44 and 2.25{\%}. Classification of glycerol adulterants in the different brands of red wine using CVA resulted in a classification accuracy in the range between 94 and 98{\%}. Artificial neural network analysis based on the quick back propagation network (BPN) and the radial basis function network (RBFN) algorithms had classification success rates of 93{\%} using BPN and 100{\%} using RBFN. The genetic algorithm network was able to predict the concentrations of glycerol in wine up to an accuracy of r2 = 0.998.},

abstract = {In realizations of quantum computing, a two-level system (qubit) is often singled out of the many levels of an anharmonic oscillator. In these cases, simple qubit control fails on short time scales because of coupling to leakage levels. We provide an easy to implement analytic formula that inhibits this leakage from any single-control analog or pixelated pulse. It is based on adding a second control that is proportional to the time-derivative of the first. For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art, all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes. These results show that even weak anharmonicity is sufficient and in general not a limiting factor for implementing quantum gates.},

abstract = {Purpose: Knowledge of the positions of field probes in an NMR field camera is necessary for monitoring the B 0 field. The typical method of estimating these positions is by switching the gradients with known strengths and calculating the positions using the phases of the FIDs. We investigated improving the accuracy of estimating the probe positions and analyzed the effect of inaccurate estimations on field monitoring. Methods: The field probe positions were estimated by 1) assuming ideal gradient fields, 2) using measured gradient fields (including nonlinearities), and 3) using measured gradient fields with relative position constraints. The fields measured with the NMR field camera were compared to fields acquired using a dual-echo gradient recalled echo B 0 mapping sequence. Comparisons were done for shim fields from second- to fourth-order shim terms. Results: The position estimation was the most accurate when relative position constraints were used in conjunction with measured (nonlinear) gradient fields. The effect of more accurate position estimates was seen when compared to fields measured using a B 0 mapping sequence (up to 10{\%}–15{\%} more accurate for some shim fields). The models acquired from the field camera are sensitive to noise due to the low number of spatial sample points. Conclusion: Position estimation of field probes in an NMR camera can be improved using relative position constraints and nonlinear gradient fields.

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the optimal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol in pregnant women suspected of having acute appendicitis. Materials and methods: One hundred and forty-six pregnant women with suspected appendicitis were included. MR images were reviewed by two radiologists in three separate sessions. In session 1, only axial single-shot turbo spin echo (SSH-TSE) T2-weighted images (WI) were included with other routine sequences. In sessions 2 and 3, coronal and sagittal T2WI were sequentially added. The visibility of the appendix and diagnostic confidence of appendicitis were evaluated in each session using a 5-point grading scale. If diseases other than appendicitis were suspected, specific diagnosis with a 5-point confidence scale was recorded. Diagnostic performance for appendicitis and other diseases were evaluated. Results: Twenty-five patients (17.1{\%}) were diagnosed with appendicitis. Among the patients with normal appendix, 28 were diagnosed with other disease. Diagnostic performance including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the curve values for diagnosing appendicitis and other diseases showed no significant difference among sets for both reviewers (p{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusion: Diagnostic performance of MR in pregnant patients with suspected appendicitis can be preserved with omission of sagittal or both coronal and sagittal SSH-T2WI. Key points: • Diagnostic performance of appendicitis is preserved with omission of sagittal/coronal T2WIs. • Diagnosis of other disease may be sufficient with axial T2WIs only. • Careful serial omission of sagittal and coronal T2WIs can be considered.},

After introducing the basics of quantum mechanics, the book derives a class of models for quantum control systems from fundamental physics. It examines the controllability and observability of quantum systems and the related problem of quantum state determination and measurement. The author also uses Lie group decompositions as tools to analyze dynamics and to design control algorithms. In addition, he describes various other control methods and discusses topics in quantum information theory that include entanglement and entanglement dynamics. The final chapter covers the implementation of quantum control and dynamics in several fields.

abstract = {The need for efficient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental applica- tions, such as the water quality monitoring in rivers and lakes, motivates the use of robotic sensors in order to achieve sufficient spatial coverage. Typically, these robots have bounded resources, such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements. Thus, careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected, while respecting the resource constraints. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for near-optimally solv- ing the NP -hard optimization problem of planning such informative paths. In particular, we first develop e SIP (efficient Single-robot Informative Path planning), an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot. Hereby, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underly- ing phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using e SIP is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution. We then provide a general technique, sequential allocation , which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm, such as e SIP , for the multi-robot problem. This procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the single-robot problem to the multi-robot case. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed in-field for two important environmental sensing applications, lake and river monitoring, and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Purpose: 3T magnetic resonance scanners have boosted clinical application of1H-MR spectroscopy (MRS) by offering an improved signal-to-noise ratio and increased spectral resolution, thereby identifying more metabolites and extending the range of metabolic information. Spectroscopic data from clinical 1.5T MR scanners has been shown to discriminate between pediatric brain tumors by applying machine learning techniques to further aid diagnosis. The purpose of this multi-center study was to investigate the discriminative potential of metabolite profiles obtained from 3T scanners in classifying pediatric brain tumors. Methods: A total of 41 pediatric patients with brain tumors (17 medulloblastomas, 20 pilocytic astrocytomas, and 4 ependymomas) were scanned across four different hospitals. Raw spectroscopy data were processed using TARQUIN. Borderline synthetic minority oversampling technique was used to correct for the data skewness. Different classifiers were trained using linear discriminative analysis, support vector machine, and random forest techniques. Results: Support vector machine had the highest balanced accuracy for discriminating the three tumor types. The balanced accuracy achieved was higher than the balanced accuracy previously reported for similar multi-center dataset from 1.5T magnets with echo time 20 to 32 ms alone. Conclusion: This study showed that 3T MRS can detect key differences in metabolite profiles for the main types of childhood tumors.

Gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (GCMS) was used to measure the concentrations of free choline (Cho), glycerophosphocholine (GPCho), phosphocholine (PCho) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) from biopsies in the same area where MRS was performed. Cellular density, free Cho, PCho and GPCho were the strongest determinants of 1H MRS CHO while PtdCho was not. Just as the1 H MRS 2.0 peak reflects both the concentration of n-acetyl-1-aspartate and neuronal density, the 1H MRS 3.2 peak reflects the concentration of water-soluble choline-containing compounds and cellular density.},

We discuss how these methods can be combined in gradient optimization using parametrization (GROUP) including the finite bandwidth of the control electronics.

abstract = {The construction of decision-theoretic Bayesian designs for realistically-complex nonlinear models is computationally challenging, as it requires the optimization of analytically intractable expected utility functions over high-dimensional design spaces. We provide the most general solution to date for this problem through a novel approximate coordinate exchange algorithm. This methodology uses a Gaussian process emulator to approximate the expected utility as a function of a single design coordinate in a series of conditional optimization steps. It has flexibility to address problems for any choice of utility function and for a wide range of statistical models with different numbers of variables, numbers of runs and randomization restrictions. In contrast to existing approaches to Bayesian design, the method can find multi-variable designs in large numbers of runs without resorting to asymptotic approximations to the posterior distribution or expected utility. The methodology is demonstrated on a variety of challenging examples of practical importance, including design for pharmacokinetic models and design for mixed models with discrete data. For many of these models, Bayesian designs are not currently available. Comparisons are made to results from the literature, and to designs obtained from asymptotic approximations.},

abstract = {We address the problem of online path planning for optimal sensing with a mobile robot. The objective of the robot is to learn the most about its pose and the environment given time constraints. We use a POMDP with a utility function that depends on the belief state to model the finite horizon planning problem. We replan as the robot progresses throughout the environment. The POMDP is high-dimensional, continuous, non-differentiable, nonlinear, non-Gaussian and must be solved in real-time. Most existing techniques for stochastic planning and reinforcement learning are therefore inapplicable. To solve this extremely complex problem, we propose a Bayesian optimization method that dynamically trades off exploration (minimizing uncertainty in unknown parts of the policy space) and exploitation (capitalizing on the current best solution). We demonstrate our approach with a visually-guide mobile robot. The solution proposed here is also applicable to other closely-related domains, including active vision, sequential experimental design, dynamic sensing and calibration with mobile sensors.},

The optimization of controls that steer quantum systems to desired objectives can itself be considered a classical dynamical system that executes an analog computation. The system-independent component of the equations of motion of this dynamical system can be integrated analytically for various classes of discrete quantum control problems. For the maximization of observable expectation values from an initial pure state and the maximization of the fidelity of quantum gates, the time complexity of the corresponding computation belongs to the class continuous log (CLOG), the lowest analog complexity class, equivalent to the discrete complexity class NC. The simple scaling of the Hamiltonian-independent contribution to these problems with quantum system dimension indicates that with appropriately designed search algorithms, quantum optimal control can be rendered efficient even for large systems.},

With the increasing of variables and complexity, OC problems can no longer be solved analytically and, consequently, numerical methods are required. For this purpose, direct and indirect methods are used. Direct methods consist in the discretization of the OC problem, reducing it to a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Indirect methods are based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, which in turn reduces to a boundary value problem. In order to have a more reliable solution, one can solve the same problem through different approaches. Here, as an illustrative example, an epidemiological application related to the rubella disease is solved using several software packages, such as the routine ode45 of Matlab, OC-ODE, DOTcvp toolbox, IPOPT and Snopt, showing the state of the art of numerical software for OC.},

Given an underlying metric between pairs of set elements, we introduce a natural metric between sets of sensors for this task. Using this metric, we can construct covariance functions over sets, and thereby perform Gaussian process inference over a function whose domain is a power set. If the function has additional in- puts, our covariances can be readily extended to incorporate them—allowing us to consider, for example, functions over both sets and time. These functions can then be optimized using Gaussian process global optimization (GPGO). We use the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions made using a set of sensors at a particular time as an ex- ample of such a function to be optimized; the optimal point specifies the best choice of sensor locations. We demonstrate the resulting method by dynamically selecting the best sub- set of a given set of weather sensors for the prediction of the air temperature across the United Kingdom.},

In return, astrocytes release glutamine to be taken up into neurons for use as neurotransmitter precursor. In this review, the basic properties of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle will be discussed, including aspects of transport and metabolism. Discussions of stoichiometry, the relative role of glutamate vs. GABA and pathological conditions affecting the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycling are presented. Furthermore, a section is devoted to the accompanying ammonia homeostasis of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle, examining the possible means of intercellular transfer of ammonia produced in neurons (when glutamine is deamidated to glutamate) and utilized in astrocytes (for amidation of glutamate) when the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle is operating. A main objective of this review is to endorse the view that the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle must be seen as a bi-directional transfer of not only carbon units but also nitrogen units.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to exhibit a quantum network phenomenon - the anti-core---that goes against the classical network concept of congestion core. Classical networks idealized as infinite, Gromov hyperbolic spaces with least-cost path routing (and subject to a technical condition on the Gromov boundary) have a congestion core, defined as a subnetwork that routing paths have a high probability of visiting. Here, we consider quantum networks, more specifically spin chains, define the so-called maximum excitation transfer probability {\$}p{\_}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}(i,j){\$} between spin {\$}i{\$} and spin {\$}j{\$}, and show that the central spin has among all other spins the lowest probability of being excited or transmitting its excitation. The anti-core is singled out by analytical formulas for {\$}p{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}max{\}}{\}}(i,j){\$}, revealing the number theoretic properties of quantum chains. By engineering the chain, we further show that this probability can be made vanishingly small.},

The methodology is applied to obtain broadband excitation with unprecedented tolerance to RF inhomogeneity. Design criteria were transformation of Iz → Ix over resonance offsets of ±25 kHz for constant RF amplitude anywhere in the range 10-20 kHz, with a pulse length of 1 ms. Simulations transform Iz to greater than 0.99 Ix over the targetted ranges of resonance offset and RF variability. Phase deviations in the final magnetization are less than 2-3° over almost the entire range, with sporadic deviations of 6-9° at a few offsets for the lowest RF (10 kHz) in the optimized range. Experimental performance of the new pulse is in excellent agreement with the simulations, and the robustness of the excitation pulse and a derived refocusing pulse are demonstrated by insertion into conventional HSQC and HMBC-type experiments. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Compared with the spectral sensitivity obtained on an otherwise identical system operating at 1.5 T, the singlet resonance of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) was decreased by a factor of 1.48, which is significantly less than expected using the ratio of Boltzman populations at the two field strengths. However, the resonances of Glx at 0.5 T increased in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a factor of 2. The increased SNR of Glx is principally due to improved B0 main-field homogeneity and collapse of the strongly J-coupled Glx resonances. Our preliminary results suggest that midfield proton MRS will provide significant clinical utility in the detection of Glx levels in human brain.},

Suppose the system of interest which has Hilbert space H is coupled to some environnment with space H E . The total system is isolated and is described by a state vector |$\Psi$ ∈ H ⊗ H E . An observable for the system of interest is of the form A ⊗ I where A acts only in H. We suppose that A has spectral decomposition A = n a n P n so that A ⊗ I = n a n P n ⊗ I A measurement of the observable will leave the system in one of the states P n ⊗ I|$\Psi$ n ⊗ I|$\Psi$ 1/2 with probability prob(n) = n ⊗ I|$\Psi$ and the average value of the observable is ⊗ I|$\Psi$ If we introduce the matrix 1 $\rho$ = T r H E |$\Psi$ which acts on H, we can rewrite all these formulas as follows, prob(n) = T rP n ⊗ I|$\Psi$ = T r H T r E P n ⊗ I|$\Psi$ = T r H P n $\rho$ 1 here a partial trace is performed.

The method was used to develop a novel approach for finding optimal controls for quantum systems in [D.J. Tannor, V. Kazakov, V.

The review discusses mathematical aspects of this method for optimal control of closed quantum systems. It outlines various modifications with respect to defining the improvement function (which in most cases is linear or linear-quadratic), constraints on control spectrum and on the states of a quantum system, regularizers, etc. The review describes applications of the Krotov method to control of molecular dynamics, manipulation of Bose-Einstein condensate, quantum gate generation.

abstract = {A Markovian master equation describing the evolution of open quantum systems in the presence of a time-dependent external field is derived within the Bloch-Redfield formalism. It leads to a system-bath interaction which depends on the control field. Optimal control theory is used to select control fields which allow accelerated or decelerated system relaxation, or suppression of relaxation (dissipation) altogether, depending on the dynamics we impose on the quantum system. The control-dissipation correlation and the nonperturbative treatment of the control field are essential for reaching this goal. The optimal control problem is formulated within Pontryagin's minimum principle and the resulting optimal differential system is solved numerically. As an application, we study the dynamics of a spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime under the influence of an external control field. We show how trapping the system in unstable quantum states and transfer of population can be achieved by optimized control of the dissipative quantum system. We also used optimal control theory to find the driving field that generates the quantum Z gate. In several cases studied, we find that the selected optimal field which reduces the purity loss significantly is a multicomponent low-frequency field including higher harmonics, all of which lie below the phonon cutoff frequency. Finally, in the undriven case we present an analytic result for the Lamb shift at zero temperature.},

abstract = {A common goal of quantum control is to maximize a physical observable through the application of a tailored field. The observable value as a function of the field constitutes a quantum control landscape. Previous works have shown, under specified conditions, that the quantum control landscape should be free of suboptimal critical points. This favorable landscape topology is one factor contributing to the efficiency of climbing the landscape. An additional, complementary factor is the landscape $\backslash$textit{\{}structure{\}}, which constitutes all non-topological features. If the landscape's structure is too complex, then climbs may be forced to take inefficient convoluted routes to finding optimal controls. This paper provides a foundation for understanding control landscape structure by examining the linearity of gradient-based optimization trajectories through the space of control fields. For this assessment, a metric {\$}R\backslashgeq 1{\$} is defined as the ratio of the path length of the optimization trajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial control field and the resultant optimal control field that takes an observable from the bottom to the top of the landscape. Computational analyses for simple model quantum systems are performed to ascertain the relative abundance of nearly straight control trajectories encountered when optimizing a state-to-state transition probability. The collected results indicate that quantum control landscapes have very simple structural features. The favorable topology and the complementary simple structure of the control landscape provide a basis for understanding the generally observed ease of optimizing a state-to-state transition probability.},

Experimental results are shown for cat brain at 4.7 T and human brain at 1.5 T. Both STEAM and PRESS are highly effective localization methods. For long echo times, PRESS is the method of choice, because it offers a factor of two gain in signal intensity. In addition, the method is less sensitive to motion and diffusion, and not susceptible to multiple-quantum effects. STEAM offers advantages for observation of (coupled) metabolites with short T,, because (a) shorter TEs can be attained and (b) effective water suppression sequences can be implemented without penalty in echo time.

abstract = {Creatine is a nitrogen containing compound that serves as an energy shuttle between the mitochondrial sites of ATP production and the cytosol where ATP is utilized. There are two known disorders of creatine synthesis (both transmitted as autosomal recessive traits: arginine: glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency; OMIM 602360; and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (OMIM 601240)) and one disorder of creatine transport (X-linked recessive SLC6A8 creatine transporter deficiency (OMIM 300036)). All these disorders are characterized by brain creatine deficiency, detectable by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Affected patients can have mental retardation, hypotonia, autism or behavioral problems and seizures. The diagnosis of these conditions relies on the measurement of plasma and urine creatine and guanidinoacetate. Creatine levels in plasma are reduced in both creatine synthesis defects and guanidinoacetate is increased in GAMT deficiency. The urine creatine/creatinine ratio is elevated in creatine transporter deficiency with normal plasma levels of creatine and guanidinoacetate. The diagnosis is confirmed in all cases by DNA testing or functional studies. Defects of creatine biosynthesis are treated with creatine supplements and, in GAMT deficiency, with ornithine and dietary restriction of arginine through limitation of protein intake. No causal therapy is yet available for creatine transporter deficiency and supplementation with the guanidinoacetate precursors arginine and glycine is being explored. The excellent response to therapy of early identified patients with GAMT or AGAT deficiency candidates these condition for inclusion in newborn screening programs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Th e objective of th is study was to assess factors affecting HIV counselling and testing (HCT) among adults in Muheza district in north - eastern Tanzania . A total of 394 adults were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. The majority of the study participants were females ( N =213; 54. 1{\%} ) .

Seventy one percent of all participants viewed HCT positively. A significant proportion of married (17.7{\%}) and un - married (16.5{\%}) participants judged HCT as not essential as it would not change the test result. Sixty - eight percent of the respondents did n ot consider themselves at risk and most of them ( 71{\%} ) were married. Importantly, 26{\%} reported being scared of discrimination. In conclusion our study results demonstrate that only half of the study population had adequate knowledge of HCT. Being married was considered as a ‘protective' factor in terms HIV risk which indicates a misconception. These findings und erscore the importance of proper HIV counselling and testing in this community so as to bridge the knowledge gap. It further demonstrates the need to address in detail misconceptions during HIV counselling and testing.},

abstract = {Background: The clinical and biological effects of metabolic alterations in cancer are not fully understood. Methods: In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) samples (n = 101), over 170 metabolites were profiled and compared with normal ovarian tissues (n = 15). To determine NAT8L gene expression across different cancer types, we analyzed the RNA expression of cancer types using RNASeqV2 data available from the open access The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/). Using NAT8L siRNA, molecular techniques and histological analysis, we determined cancer cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor growth in in vitro and in vivo (n = 6-10 mice/group) settings. Data were analyzed with the Student's t test and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Patients with high levels of tumoral NAA and its biosynthetic enzyme, aspartate N-acetyltransferase (NAT8L), had worse overall survival than patients with low levels of NAA and NAT8L. The overall survival duration of patients with higher-than-median NAA levels (3.6 years) was lower than that of patients with lower-than-median NAA levels (5.1 years, P =. 03). High NAT8L gene expression in other cancers (melanoma, renal cell, breast, colon, and uterine cancers) was associated with worse overall survival. NAT8L silencing reduced cancer cell viability (HEYA8: control siRNA 90.61{\%}±2.53, NAT8L siRNA 39.43{\%}±3.00, P {\textless}. 001; A2780: control siRNA 90.59{\%}±2.53, NAT8L siRNA 7.44{\%}±1.71, P {\textless}. 001) and proliferation (HEYA8: control siRNA 74.83{\%}±0.92, NAT8L siRNA 55.70{\%}±1.54, P {\textless}. 001; A2780: control siRNA 50.17{\%}±4.13, NAT8L siRNA 26.52{\%}±3.70, P {\textless}. 001), which was rescued by addition of NAA. In orthotopic mouse models (ovarian cancer and melanoma), NAT8L silencing reduced tumor growth statistically significantly (A2780: control siRNA 0.52 g±0.15, NAT8L siRNA 0.08 g±0.17, P {\textless}. 001; HEYA8: control siRNA 0.79 g±0.42, NAT8L siRNA 0.24 g±0.18, P =. 008, A375-SM: control siRNA 0.55 g±0.22, NAT8L siRNA 0.21 g±0.17g, P =. 001). NAT8L silencing downregulated the anti-apoptotic pathway, which was mediated through FOXM1. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the NAA pathway has a prominent role in promoting tumor growth and represents a valuable target for anticancer therapy. Altered energy metabolism is a hallmark of cancer (1). Proliferating cancer cells have much greater metabolic requirements than nonproliferating differentiated cells (2,3). Moreover, altered cancer metabolism elevates unique metabolic intermediates, which can promote cancer survival and progression (4,5). Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that proliferating cancer cells exploit alternative metabolic pathways to meet their high demand for energy and to accumulate biomass (6-8).},

The experimental procedure is described in detail. Resonance assignments include acetate, N-acetyl aspartate, r-amino butyrate, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, choline-containing compounds, taurine, and inositols. Cerebral lactate was found to be at a maximum concentration of0.5 mM when assuming N-acetyl aspartate in white matter to be 6 mM.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that abnormalities in glutamate signalling may contribute to the pathophysiology of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ([1H]MRS) can be used to measure glutamate, and also its metabolite glutamine, in vivo. However, few studies have investigated glutamate in the brain of adults with ADHD naive to stimulant medication. Therefore, we used [1H]MRS to measure the combined signal of glutamate and glutamine (Glu+Gln; abbreviated as Glx) along with other neurometabolites such as creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline. Data were acquired from three brain regions, including two implicated in ADHD-the basal ganglia (caudate/striatum) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-and one 'control' region-the medial parietal cortex. We compared 40 adults with ADHD, of whom 24 were naive for ADHD medication, whereas 16 were currently on stimulants, against 20 age, sex and IQ-matched healthy controls. We found that compared with controls, adult ADHD participants had a significantly lower concentration of Glx, Cr and NAA in the basal ganglia and Cr in the DLPFC, after correction for multiple comparisons. There were no differences between stimulant-treated and treatment-naive ADHD participants. In people with untreated ADHD, lower basal ganglia Glx was significantly associated with more severe symptoms of inattention. There were no significant differences in the parietal 'control' region. We suggest that subcortical glutamate and glutamine have a modulatory role in ADHD adults; and that differences in glutamate-glutamine levels are not explained by use of stimulant medication.},

For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space). Simulations results are presented and discussed.},

We analyze the robustness of the obtained results f or the gate fidelities to random errors in the control fields, finding that with faster switching between piecewise-constant controls the system is less susceptible to these errors. The observed behavior falls into a generic class of physical phenomena that are related to a competition between resonance- and relaxation-type behavior, exemplified by motional narrowing in NMR experiments. Finally, we discuss how the obtained optimal gate fidelities are altered when the corresponding rapidly-varying piecewise-constant control fields are smoothened through spectral filtering.},

abstract = {Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has the potential to provide valuable information about alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), and glutamine (Gln) in psychiatric and neurological disorders. In order to use this technique effectively, it is important to establish the accuracy and reproducibility of the methodology. In this study, phantoms with known metabolite concentrations were used to compare the accuracy of 2D J-resolved MRS, single-echo 30 ms PRESS, and GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS for measuring all three aforementioned neurochemicals simultaneously. The phantoms included metabolite concentrations above and below the physiological range and scans were performed at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month time-points. For GABA measurement, MEGA-PRESS proved optimal with a measured-to-target correlation of R 2 = 0.999, with J-resolved providing R 2 = 0.973 for GABA. All three methods proved effective in measuring Glu with R 2 = 0.987 (30 ms PRESS), R 2 = 0.996 (J-resolved) and R 2 = 0.910 (MEGA-PRESS). J-resolved and MEGA-PRESS yielded good results for Gln measures with respective R 2 = 0.855 (J-resolved) and R 2 = 0.815 (MEGA-PRESS). The 30 ms PRESS method proved ineffective in measuring GABA and Gln. When measurement stability at in vivo concentration was assessed as a function of varying spectral quality, J-resolved proved the most stable and immune to signal-to-noise and linewidth fluctuation compared to MEGA-PRESS and 30 ms PRESS. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

McShane (1939) and Pontryagin (1962) extended the calculus of variations to handle control variable inequality constraints, the latter enunciating his elegant maximum principle. The truly enabling element for use of optimal control theory was the digital computer, which became available commercially in the 1950s. In the 1980s research began, and continues today, on making optimal feedback logic more robust to variations in the plant and disturbance models; one element of this research is worst-case and H-infinity control, which developed out of differential game theory},

Complete model spectra, rather than individual resonances, are used in order to incorporate maximum prior information into the analysis. A nearly model-free constrained regularization method automatically accounts for the baseline and lineshape in vivo without imposing a restrictive parameterized form on them. LCModel is automatic (non-interactive) with no subjective input. Approximately maximum-likelihood estimates of the metabolite concentrations and their uncertainties (Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bounds) are obtained. LCModel analyses of spectra from users with fields from 1.5 to 9.4 T and a wide range of sequences, particularly with short TE, are used here to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of LCModel and proton MRS.

For this purpose, we adopted the Liouville space model as the standard computing engine and let the consequent computational burden be afforded by parallel computing techniques. Benefitting from the powerful Lua scripting language, the pulse sequence programming syntax was specially designed to offer an extremely concise way of scripting. Moreover, the built-in dataflow graph based optimal control scheme enables an efficient optimization of shaped pulses or multiple cooperative pulses for real-life experiment evaluations. As the name states, the users are expected to be able to realize their creative ideas like a scenarist that creates a scenario script and looks at the spin actors acting accordingly. The validation of the framework was demonstrated with several examples within MR imaging and MR spectroscopy. Spin-Scenario is available for download at https://github.com/spin-scenario.},

The scope is limited to mid-range coils – coils where the product (fd) of the frequency f and the coil diameter d is in the range of 2-30 MHz-m. Common applications include mouse brain and body coils from 125 MHz to 750 MHz, rat body coils up to 500 MHz, and small surface coils at all fields. In this regime, all the sources of loss (coil, capacitor, sample, shield, and transmission lines) are important. All such losses may be accurately captured in some modern full-wave 3D EM software, and new simulation results are presented for a selection of surface coils using Microwave Studio (MWS) 2006 by Computer Simulation Technology (CST), showing the dramatic importance of the “lift-off effect”. Standard linear circuit simulators have been shown to be useful in optimization of complex coil tuning and matching circuits. There appears to be considerable potential for trading S/N for speed using phased arrays, especially for a larger field of view. Circuit simulators are shown to be useful for optimal mismatching of ultra-low-noise preamps based on the E-PHEMT (Enhancement mode Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor) for optimal coil decoupling in phased arrays.

abstract = {In this work we propose a novel strategy using techniques from systems theory to completely eliminate decoherence and also provide conditions under which it can be done so. A novel construction employing an auxiliary system, the bait, which is instrumental to decoupling the system from the environment is presented. Our approach to decoherence control in contrast to other approaches in the literature involves the bilinear input affine model of quantum control system which lends itself to various techniques from classical control theory, but with non-trivial modifications to the quantum regime. The elegance of this approach yields interesting results on open loop decouplability and Decoherence Free Subspaces(DFS). Additionally, the feedback control of decoherence may be related to disturbance decoupling for classical input affine systems, which entails careful application of the methods by avoiding all the quantum mechanical pitfalls. In the process of calculating a suitable feedback the system has to be restructured due to its tensorial nature of interaction with the environment, which is unique to quantum systems. The results are qualitatively different and superior to the ones obtained via master equations. Finally, a methodology to synthesize feedback parameters itself is given, that technology permitting, could be implemented for practical 2-qubit systems to perform decoherence free Quantum Computing.},

abstract = {The use of increasingly strong magnetic fields in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves sensitivity, susceptibility contrast, and spatial or spectral resolution for functional and localized spectroscopic imaging applications. However, along with these benefits come the challenges of increasing static field (B0) and rf field (B1) inhomogeneities induced by radial field susceptibility differences and poorer dielectric properties of objects in the scanner. Increasing fields also impose the need for rf irradiation at higher frequencies which may lead to elevated patient energy absorption, eventually posing a safety risk. These reasons have motivated the use of multidimensional rf pulses and parallel rf transmission, and their combination with tailoring of rf pulses for fast and low-power rf performance. For the latter application, analytical and approximate solutions are well-established in linear regimes, however, with increasing nonlinearities and constraints on the rf pulses, numerical iterative methods become attractive. Among such procedures, optimal control methods have recently demonstrated great potential. Here, we present a Krotov-based optimal control approach which as compared to earlier approaches provides very fast, monotonic convergence even without educated initial guesses. This is essential for in vivo MRI applications. The method is compared to a second-order gradient ascent method relying on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method, and a hybrid scheme Krotov-BFGS is also introduced in this study. These optimal control approaches are demonstrated by the design of a 2D spatial selective rf pulse exciting the letters “JCP” in a water phantom.},

abstract = {Methods: Proton MR spectroscopy to quantify the WBNAA was applied to 197 subjects (86 females) 72.6 ± 8.4 years old (mean ± standard deviation). Of these, 102 were cognitively intact, 42 diagnosed as MCI, and 53 as probable AD. Their WBNAA amounts were converted into absolute concentration by dividing with the brain volume segmented from the MRI that also yielded the fractional brain volume (fBPV), an atrophy metric.
Results: WBNAA concentration of MCI and AD patients (10.5 ± 3.0 and 10.1 ± 2.9 mM) were not significantly different (p = 0.85). They were, however, highly significantly 25-29{\%} lower than the 14.1 ± 2.4 mM of normal matched controls (p {\textless} 10-4). The fBPV of MCI and AD patients (72.9 ± 4.9 and 69.9 ± 4.7{\%}) differed significantly from each other (4{\%}, p = 0.02) and both were significantly lower than the 74.6 ± 4.4{\%} of normal elderly (2{\%}, p = 0.003 for MCI; 6{\%}, p {\textless} 10-4 for AD). ROC curve analysis has shown WBNAA to have 70.5{\%} sensitivity and 84.3{\%} specificity to differentiate MCI or AD patients from normal elderly versus just 68.4 and 65.7{\%} for fBPV.
Conclusion: Low WBNAA in MCI patients compared with cognitively normal contemporaries may indicate early neuronal damage accumulation and supports the notion of MCI as an early stage of AD. It also suggests WBNAA as a potential marker of early AD pathology. {\textcopyright} 2015-IOS Press and the authors.
Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary state on the way to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known about whole brain concentration of the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in MCI patients.
Objective: To test the hypothesis that since MCI and AD are both neurodegenerative, quantification of the NAA in their whole brain (WBNAA) could differentiate them from cognitively-intact matched controls.},

abstract = {We discuss the conceptually different definitions used for the non-Markovianity of classical and quantum processes. The well-established definition for non-Markovianity of a classical stochastic process represents a condition on the Kolmogorov hierarchy of the n-point joint probability distributions. Since this definition cannot be transferred to the quantum regime, quantum non-Markovianity has recently been defined and quantified in terms of the underlying quantum dynamical map, using either its divisibility properties or the behavior of the trace distance between pairs of initial states. Here, we investigate and compare these definitions and their relations to the classical notion of non-Markovianity by employing a large class of non-Markovian processes, known as semi-Markov processes, which admit a natural extension to the quantum case. A number of specific physical examples is constructed which allow to study the basic features of the classical and the quantum definitions and to evaluate explicitly the measures for quantum non-Markovianity. Our results clearly demonstrate several fundamental distinctions between the classical and the quantum notion of non-Markovianity, as well as between the various quantum measures for non-Markovianity.},

In the following part, the most commonly observed nuisance signals-namely macromolecules, water, lipids, and spectral baseline-are outlined, and methods of handling these nuisance signals are discussed. The next sections list and describe some of the most commonly used software packages for quantitative analysis of MRS data and discuss signal referencing methods for both relative and absolute quantification.

Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as effective as using their randomized counterpart.

This issue is of importance in realizing quasi-stationary states of open systems such as quantum circuits and batteries. As an illustrative example, the time-dependent harmonic oscillator is analyzed. It is shown that the Lindbladian operator is uniquely determined with the help of a Lie-algebraic structure, and the time derivative of the von Neumann entropy is shown to be nonnegative if the curvature of the harmonic potential monotonically decreases in time.},

abstract = {Quantification of metabolites from magnetic resonance spectra (MRS) has many applications in medicine and psychology, but remains a challenging task despite considerable research efforts. For example, the neurotransmitter {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), present in very low concentration in vivo, regulates inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain and is involved in several processes outside the brain. Reliable quantification is required to determine its role in various physiological and pathological conditions. We present a novel approach to quantification of metabolites from MRS with convolutional neural networks --- MRSNet. MRSNet is trained to perform the multi-class regression problem of identifying relative metabolite concentrations from given input spectra, focusing specifically on the quantification of GABA, which is particularly difficult to resolve. Typically it can only be detected at all using special editing acquisition sequences such as MEGA-PRESS. A large range of network structures, data representations and automatic processing methods are investigated. Results are benchmarked using experimental datasets from test objects of known composition and compared to state-of-the-art quantification methods: LCModel, jMRUI (AQUES, QUEST), TARQUIN, VeSPA and Gannet. The results show that the overall accuracy and precision of metabolite quantification is improved using convolutional neural networks.},

abstract = {For head magnetic resonance imaging, local gradient coils are often used to achieve high solution images. To accommodate the human head and shoulder, the head gradient coils are usually designed in an asymmetric configuration, allowing the region-of-uniformity (ROU) close to the coil's patient end. However, the asymmetric configuration leads to technical difficulties in maintaining a high gradient performance for the insertable head coil with very limited space. In this work, we present a practical design configuration of an asymmetric insertable gradient head coil offering an improved performance. In the proposed design, at the patient end, the primary and secondary coils are connected using an additional radial surface, thus allowing the coil conductors distributed on the flange to ensure an improvement in the coil performance. At the service end, the primary and shielding coils are not connected, to permit access to shim trays, cooling system piping, cabling, and so on. The new designs are compared with conventional coil configurations and the simulation results show that, with a similar field quality in the ROU, the proposed coil pattern has improved construction characteristics (open service end, well-distributed wire pattern) and offers a better coil performance (lower inductance, higher efficiency, etc) than conventional head coil configurations.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, awareness of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adults has increased. The precise etiology of ASD is still unresolved. Animal research, genetic and postmortem studies suggest that the glutamate (Glu) system has an important role, possibly related to a cybernetic imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. To clarify the possible disruption of Glu metabolism in adults with high-functioning autism, we performed a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study investigating the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the cerebellum in adults with high-functioning ASD. Twenty-nine adult patients with high-functioning ASD and 29 carefully matched healthy volunteers underwent MRS scanning of the pregenual ACC and the left cerebellar hemisphere. Metabolic data were compared between groups and were correlated with psychometric measures of autistic features. We found a significant decrease in the cingulate N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and the combined Glu and glutamine (Glx) signals in adults with ASD, whereas we did not find other metabolic abnormalities in the ACC or the cerebellum. The Glx signal correlated significantly with psychometric measures of autism, particularly with communication deficits. Our data support the hypothesis that there is a link between disturbances of the cingulate NAA and Glx metabolism, and autism. The findings are discussed in the context of the hypothesis of excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in autism. Further research should clarify the specificity and dynamics of these findings regarding other neuropsychiatric disorders and other brain areas.},

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging at the ultimate sensitivity limit of single molecules or single nuclear spins requires fundamentally new detection strategies. The strong coupling regime, when interaction between sensor and sample spins dominates all other interactions, is one such strategy. In this regime, classically forbidden detection of completely unpolarized nuclei is allowed, going beyond statistical fluctuations in magnetization. Here we realize strong coupling between an atomic (nitrogen-vacancy) sensor and sample nuclei to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on four (29)Si spins. We exploit the field gradient created by the diamond atomic sensor, in concert with compressed sensing, to realize imaging protocols, enabling individual nuclei to be located with Angstrom precision. The achieved signal-to-noise ratio under ambient conditions allows single nuclear spin sensitivity to be achieved within seconds.},

This is achieved through the development of spatial-selective single-shot spiral-readout MRI and MRS experiments combined with dynamic nuclear polarization hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate on a 4.7 T pre-clinical MR scanner. The method stands out from related techniques by facilitating anatomic shaped region-of-interest (ROI) single metabolite signals available for higher image resolution or single-peak spectra. The 2D spatial-selective rf pulses were designed using a novel Krotov-based optimal control approach capable of iteratively fast providing successful pulse sequences in the absence of qualified initial guesses.

abstract = {A numerical procedure is outlined that is appropriate for the design of multiple quantum filter sequences targeted for the strongly coupled, multiple spin systems that occur in metabolites present in brain. The procedure uses numerical methods of solution of the density matrix equations, first, to establish the most appropriate resonance to target with the filter; second, to provide contour plots of a performance index of the filter in terms of critical sequence parameters; and third, to produce the response signals of the target and the background metabolites to the optimized filter. The procedure is exemplified for the AMNPQ spin system of the amino acid glutamate at a field strength of 3 T. The 2.3 ppm peak of the PQ multiplet of glutamate was identified as the target resonance, and the performance of the filter so derived was evaluated experimentally on phantom solutions and in human brain. These experiments clearly demonstrate that a linewidth of {\textless}or=4 Hz is required for full resolution of glutamate from glutamine at 3 T using this double quantum filter. Nevertheless, even at a linewidth of approximately 7 Hz in vivo, the 2.3 ppm peak of glutamate dominates the filter response and thereby removes a significant cause of uncertainty in measuring changes in glutamate by eliminating most of the background observed in unedited spectra obtained using PRESS or STEAM.},

abstract = {No compact expression of the evolution operator is known when the Hamiltonian operator is time dependent, like when Hamiltonian operators describe, in a semiclassical limit, the interaction of a molecule with an electric field. It is well known that Magnus [N. Magnus, Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 7, 649 (1954)] has derived a formal expression where the evolution operator is expressed as an exponential of an operator defined as a series. In spite of its formal simplicity, it turns out to be difficult to use at high orders. For numerical purposes, approximate methods such as "Runge-Kutta" or "split operator" are often used usually, however, to a small order ({\textless}5), so that only small time steps, about one-tenth or one-hundredth of the field cycle, are acceptable. Moreover, concerning the latter method, split operator, it is only very efficient when a diagonal representation of the kinetic energy operator is known. The Taylor expansion of the evolution operator or the wave function about the initial time provides an alternative approach, which is very simple to implement and, unlike split operator, without restrictions on the Hamiltonian. In addition, relatively large time steps (up to the field cycle) can be used. A two-level model and a propagation of a Gaussian wave packet in a harmonic potential illustrate the efficiency of the Taylor expansion. Finally, the calculation of the time-averaged absorbed energy in fluoroproprene provides a realistic application of our method.},

In many situations where it was generally believed that active learning does not help, we show that active learning does help in the limit, often with exponential improvements in sample complexity. This contrasts with the traditional analysis of active learning problems such as non-homogeneous linear separators or depth-limited decision trees, in which $\Omega$(1/$\epsilon$) lower bounds are common. Such lower bounds should be interpreted carefully; indeed, we prove that it is always possible to learn an $\epsilon$-good classifier with a number of samples asymptotically smaller than this. These new insights arise from a subtle variation on the traditional definition of sample complexity, not previously recognized in the active learning literature.},

abstract = {Ultrafast (UF) 2D NMR enables the acquisition of 2D spectra within a single-scan. This methodology has become a powerful analytical tool, used in a large array of applications. However, UF NMR spectroscopy still suffers from the need to compromise between sensitivity, spectral width and resolution. With the commonly used UF-COSY pulse sequence, resolution issues are compounded by the presence of strong auto-correlation signals, particularly in the case of samples with high dynamic ranges. The recently proposed concept of UF Double Quantum Spectroscopy (DQS) allows a better peak separation as it provides a lower spectral peak density. This paper presents the detailed investigation of this new NMR tool in an analytical chemistry context. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations are used to characterize the modulation of peak intensities as a function of pulse-sequence parameters, and thus enable a significant enhancement of the sensitivity. The analytical comparison of UF-COSY and UF-DQS shows similar performances, however the ultrafast implementation of the DQS approach is found to have some sensitivity advantages over its conventional counterpart. The analytical performance of the pulse sequence is illustrated by the quantification of taurine in complex mixtures (homemade and commercial energy drinks). The results demonstrate the high potential of this experiment, which forms a valuable alternative to UF-COSY spectra when the latter are characterized by strong overlaps and high dynamic ranges.},

abstract = {1. The possible role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human cerebral cortex was investigated with the use of intracellular recordings from neocortical slices maintained in vitro. 2. Electrical stimulation of afferents to presumed pyramidal cells resulted in an initial excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) followed by fast and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). The early IPSP had an average reversal potential of -68 mV, was associated with a mean 67-nS increase in membrane conductance, was reduced by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline, was sensitive to the intracellular injection of Cl-, and was mimicked by the GABAA agonist muscimol. 3. The late IPSP, in contrast, had an average reversal potential of -95 mV, was associated with a mean 12-nS increase in membrane conductance, was reduced by the GABAB antagonist phaclofen, and was mimicked by the GABAB agonist baclofen. 4. Block of the early IPSP by bicuculline or picrotoxin led to the generation of paroxysmal epileptiform activity, which could be further enhanced by reduction of the late IPSP. 5. These data strongly support the hypothesis that GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human cerebral cortex and that GABAergic IPSPs play an important role in controlling the excitability and responsiveness of cortical neurons.},

@article{Zhang2006,
abstract = {This thesis concentrates on the reduction of field (both main field B0 and RF field B1) inhomogeneity in MRI, especially at high B0 field. B0 and B1 field inhomogeneity are major hindrances in high B0 field MRI applications. B1 inhomogeneity will lead to spatially varying signal intensity in the MR images. B0 inhomogeneity produces blurring, distortion and signal loss at tissue interfaces. B0 artifacts are usually termed off-resonance or susceptibility artifacts. None of the existing methods can perfectly correct these inhomogeneity artifacts. This thesis aims at developing three-dimensional (3D) tailored RF (TRF) pulses to mitigate these artifacts. A current limitation in the use of 3D TRF techniques, however, is that pulses are often too long for practical clinical applications. Multiple transmission techniques are proposed to decrease pulse lengths and provide an inherent correction for B1 inhomogeneity. Shorter pulses are also more robust to profile distortions from susceptibility effects. Specifically, slice-selective 3D TRF pulses for multiple (or “parallel”) transmitters were designed and validated in uniform phantom and human brain experiments at 3 Tesla. A pseudo-transmit sensitivity encoding (“transmit SENSE”) method was introduced using a body coil transmitter and multiple receivers to mimic the real parallel transmitter experiment. The kz-direction was controlled by fast switching of gradients in a fashion similar to Echo planar imaging (EPI). The transverse plane (kx-ky) was sampled sparsely with hexagonal trajectories, and accelerated with the transmit SENSE method. The transmit SENSE 3D TRF pulses reduced the B1 inhomogeneity compared to standard SINC pulses in human brain scans. The undersampled transmit SENSE pulses were only 4.3ms long and could excite a 5mm thick slice, which is very promising for clinical applications. Furthermore, these pulses are shown by numerical simulation to have promise in correcting through-plane susceptibility artifacts.},

abstract = {Standard optimal control methods perform optimization in the time domain. However, many experimental settings demand the expression of the control signal as a superposition of given waveforms. Since this type of constraint is not time-local, Optimal Control Theory cannot be used without modifications. Simplex methods, used as a substitute in this case, tend to be less efficient and less reliable than Optimal Control Theory. In this paper, we present an extension to Optimal Control Theory which allows gradient-based optimization for superpositions of arbitrary waveforms. Its key is the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse as an efficient means of transforming from a time-local to a waveform-based description. To illustrate this optimization technique, we study the parametrically driven harmonic oscillator as model system and reduce its energy, considering both Hamiltonian dynamics and open-system dynamics. We demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the method for these test cases.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate possible abnormal increase in thalamic glutamate/glutamine levels for restless legs syndrome (RLS) indicating increased glutamatergic activity producing arousal that at night disrupts and shortens sleep. Methods: 1 H MRS of the right thalamus was performed using a 1.5 T GE MRI scanner and the PROBE-P (PRESS) on 28 patients with RLS and 20 matched controls. The Glx signal (combination of mostly glutamate [Glu] and glutamine [Gln]) was assessed as a ratio to the total creatine (Cr). This study tested 2 primary hypotheses: 1) higher thalamic Glx/Cr for patients with RLS than controls; 2) thalamic Glx/Cr correlates with increased wake during the sleep period. Results: The Glx/Cr was higher for patients with RLS than controls (mean 6 SD 1.20 6 0.73 vs 0.80 6 0.39, t 5 2.2, p 5 0.016) and correlated significantly with the wake time during the sleep period (r 5 0.61, p 5 0.007) and all other RLS-related polysomnographic sleep variables (p , 0.05) except for periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS)/hour. Conclusions: The primary findings introduce 2 new related dimensions to RLS: abnormalities in a major nondopaminergic neurologic system and the arousal disturbance of sleep. The strong relation of the arousal sleep disturbance to glutamate and the lack of relation to the PLMS motor features of RLS contrasts with the reverse for dopamine of a limited relation to arousal sleep disturbance but strong relation to PLMS. Understanding this dichotomy and the interaction of these 2 differing systems may be important for understanding RLS neurobiology and developing better treatments for RLS.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a rest-induced, movement-responsive, mostly nocturnal, urge to move the legs commonly associated with periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS). 1 Sleep disruption is the primary factor producing most of the morbidity of moderate to severe RLS. 2 Patients with RLS, however, rarely report problems with excessive daytime sleep despite total sleep times averaging less than 5.5 hours. 3 Untreated subjects with RLS who have no other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) have not been found in any clinical study to have a problem falling asleep while driving nor do they show the degree of frontal lobe cognitive deficits expected from their sleep loss. 4 Dopaminergic treatments provide effective treatment for RLS symptoms and dramatically reduce PLMS but in most studies fail to significantly reduce the sleep loss, arousals during sleep, 5-7 and abnormal cycling alternating pattern of sleep occurring with RLS. 8 Dopaminergic systems do not appear to be primary for producing the RLS sleep/wake arousal. If not dopamine, then what produces this RLS arousal pattern? A review of potential nondopa-minergic systems led to the consideration that increased glutamatergic system activation may produce the RLS arousal pattern.

The quantitation methods currently available are generally labor intensive and cannot readily be automated. Here, an algorithm is presented for the automatic time domain analysis of high-resolution NMR spectra. The TARQUIN algorithm uses a set of basis functions obtained by quantum mechanical simulation using predetermined parameters. Each basis function is optimized by subdividing it into a set of signals from magnetically equivalent spins and varying the simulated chemical shifts of each of these groups to match the signal undergoing analysis. A novel approach to the standard multidimensional minimization problem is introduced based on evaluating the fit resulting from different permutations of possible chemical shifts, obtained from one-dimensional searches. Results are presented from the analysis of 1H proton magic angle spinning spectra of cell lines illustrating the robustness of the method in a typical application.

Localization was achieved by stimulated echo (STEAM) sequences using a conventional 1.5‐T whole‐body MRI system (Siemens Magnetom). The proton NMR spectra show resonances from lipids, lactate, acetate, Nacetylaspartate (NAA), $\gamma$‐aminobutyrate, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, choline‐containing compounds, taurine, and inositols. While T1 relaxation times of most of these metabolites were about 1100–1700 ms without significant regional differences, their T2 relaxation times varied between 100 and 500 ms. The longest T2 values of about (500 ± 50) ms were observed for the methyl protons of NAA in the white matter of the occipital lobe compared to (320 ± 30) ms in the other parts of the brain. No significant regional T2 differences were found for choline and creatine methyl resonances. The relative concentrations of NAA in gray and white matter were found to be 35{\%} higher than those in the thalamus and cerebellum. Assuming a concentration of 10 mM for total creatine the resulting NAA concentrations of 13–18 mMare by a factor of 2–3 higher than previously reported using analytical techniques.

Similarly, the number of purified compounds with reference to NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS spectra has more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds). In addition to this significant expansion in database size, many new database searching tools and new data content has been added or enhanced. These include better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic maps.

Here, we review studies that aim to systematically characterize these properties, enabling the classification of quantum control mechanisms and the design of globally efficient quantum control algorithms.},

abstract = {Most modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for object recognition are built using the same principles: Alternating convolution and max-pooling layers followed by a small number of fully connected layers. We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

abstract = {The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) plays a key role in emotion processing and regulation. vmPFC dysfunction may lead to disinhibition of amygdala causing high anxiety levels. $\gamma$-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) inter-neurons within vmPFC shape the information flow to amygdala. Thus, we hypothesize that GABA content within vmPFC could be relevant to trait anxiety. Forty-three healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 88 years were assessed for trait anxiety with the Subscale-2 of the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y2) and were studied with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to investigate GABA and Glx (glutamate+glutamine) contents within vmPFC. Total creatine (tCr) was used as internal reference. Partial correlations assessed the association between metabolite levels and STAI-Y2 scores, removing the effect of possible nuisance factors including age, educational level, volumes of grey (GM) and white matter (WM) within MRS voxel. We observed a positive relationship between GABA/tCr and STAI-Y2 scores. No significant relationships were found between Glx/tCr and STAI-Y2 and between tCr/water and STAI-Y2. No differences were found between males and females as regards to age, STAI-Y2, GABA/tCr, Glx/tCr, tCr/water, GM and WM volumes. We suggest a close relationship between GABA content within vmPFC and trait anxiety providing new insights in the physiology of emotional brain.},

abstract = {Radiofrequency (RF) coils are an essential MRI hardware component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for specific clinical applications. RF coils are the “antennas” of the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses (B+1) to rotate the net magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic field (B0), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization. Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil (B-1) changes, which generates a current I. This signal is “picked-up” by an antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and summarizes the current advances and developments in technology.

abstract = {N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is employed as a non-invasive marker for neuronal health using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This utility is afforded by the fact that NAA is one of the most concentrated brain metabolites and that it produces the largest peak in MRS scans of the healthy human brain. NAA levels in the brain are reduced proportionately to the degree of tissue damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the reductions parallel the reductions in ATP levels. Because NAA is the most concentrated acetylated metabolite in the brain, we have hypothesized that NAA acts in part as an extensive reservoir of acetate for acetyl coenzyme A synthesis. Therefore, the loss of NAA after TBI impairs acetyl coenzyme A dependent functions including energy derivation, lipid synthesis, and protein acetylation reactions in distinct ways in different cell populations. The enzymes involved in synthesizing and metabolizing NAA are predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, and therefore some proportion of NAA must be transferred between cell types before the acetate can be liberated, converted to acetyl coenzyme A and utilized. Studies have indicated that glucose metabolism in neurons is reduced, but that acetate metabolism in astrocytes is increased following TBI, possibly reflecting an increased role for non-glucose energy sources in response to injury. NAA can provide additional acetate for intercellular metabolite trafficking to maintain acetyl CoA levels after injury. Here we explore changes in NAA, acetate, and acetyl coenzyme A metabolism in response to brain injury. {\textcopyright} 2013 Moffett, Arun, Ariyannur and Namboodiri.},

While MRI uses the signal from hydrogen protons to form anatomic images, proton MRS uses this information to determine the concentration of brain metabolites such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and lactate in the tissue examined. The most widely used clinical application of MRS has been in the evaluation of central nervous system disorders.MRS has its limitations and is not always specific but, with good technique and in combination with clinical information and conventional MRI, can be very helpful in diagnosing certain entities. For example, a specific pattern of metabolites can be seen in disorders such as Canavan's disease, creatine deficiency, and untreated bacterial brain abscess. MRS may also be helpful in the differentiation of high grade from low grade brain tumors, and perhaps in separating recurrent brain neoplasm from radiation injury.},

abstract = {In the last ten to fifteen years many phenomena that could only be studied using physical experiments can now be studied by computer experiments. Advances in the mathematical modeling of many physical processes, in algorithms for solving mathematical systems, and in computer speeds, have combined to make it possible to replace some physical experiments with computer experiments. In a computer experiment, a deterministic output, y⊗, is computed for each set of in- put variables, x. This paper is concerned with the commonly occuring situation in which there are two types of input variables: suppose x =(xc,xe)where xc is a set of “manufacturing” (control) variables and xe is a set of “environmental” (noise) variables. Manufacturing variables can be controlled while environmental variables are not controllable but have values governed by some distribution. We introduce a sequential experimental design for finding the optimum of (xc)= E{\{}y(xc,Xe){\}}, where the expectation is taken over the distribution of the environmental variables. The approach is Bayesian; the prior information is that y⊗is a draw from a sta- tionary Gaussian stochastic process with correlation function from theMat´ ern class having unknown parameters. The idea of the method is to compute the posterior expected “improvement” over the current optimum for each untested site; the de- sign selects the next site to maximize the expected improvement. The procedure is illustrated with examples from the literature.},

Epilepsy is one of the main symptoms in GAMT and CT1 deficiency, whereas the occurrence of febrile convulsions in infancy is a relatively common presenting symptom in all the three above-mentioned diseases. GAMT deficiency results in a severe early onset epileptic encephalopathy with development arrest, neurologic deterioration, drug-resistant seizures, movement disorders, mental disability, and autistic-like behavior. In this disorder, epilepsy and associated abnormalities on electroencephalography (EEG) are more responsive to substitutive treatment with creatine monohydrate than to conventional antiepileptic drugs. AGAT deficiency is mainly characterized by mental retardation and severe language disorder without epilepsy. In CT1 deficiency epilepsy is generally less severe than in GAMT deficiency. All creatine disorders can be investigated through measurement of creatine metabolites in body fluids, brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), and molecular genetic techniques. Blood guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) assessment and brain H-MRS examination should be part of diagnostic workup for all patients presenting with epileptic encephalopathy of unknown origin. In girls with learning and/or intellectual disabilities with or without epilepsy, SLC6A8 gene assessment should be part of the diagnostic procedures. The aims of this review are the following: (1) to describe the electroclinical features of epilepsy occurring in inborn errors of creatine metabolism; and (2) to delineate the metabolic alterations associated with GAMT, AGAT, and CT1 deficiency and the role of a substitutive therapeutic approach on their clinical and electroencephalographic epileptic patterns. {\textcopyright} Wiley Periodicals, Inc. {\textcopyright} 2012 International League Against Epilepsy.},

abstract = {Quantum optimal control theory is applied to two and three coupled Josephson charge qubits. It is shown that by using shaped pulses a CNOT gate can be obtained with a trace fidelity {\textgreater} 0.99999 for the two qubits, and even when including higher charge states, the leakage is below 1{\%}. Yet, the required time is only a fifth of the pioneering experiment [T. Yamamoto et al., Nature 425 (2003), 941] for otherwise identical parameters. The controls have palindromic smooth time courses representable by superpositions of a few harmonics. We outline schemes to generate these shaped pulses such as simple network synthesis. The approach is easy to generalise to larger systems as shown by a fast realisation of TOFFOLI's gate in three linearly coupled charge qubits. Thus it is to be anticipated that this method will find wide application in coherent quantum control of systems with finite degrees of freedom whose dynamics are Lie-algebraically closed.},

Estimation of these concentrations provides information about the biochemical characteristics of the tissue and are finally used as a complementary information in the diagnosis of cancer, epilepsy and metabolic diseases. Obtaining reliable metabolite concentrations is still a challenge due to the experimental conditions affecting the spectral quality. The decay of MRS signals (lineshape of MR spectra), for instance, is affected by inhomogeneities in the magnetic field caused by shimming problems and tissue heterogeneities. To handle this type of distortions, we study a method where the unsuppressed water is used to correct lineshape distortions, an inversion recovery signal is used to account for macromolecules and lipids present in the tissue and splines are used to correct additional baseline distortions. In this study, we consider rat brain in vivo signals and quantify them taking into account both lineshape distortions and the background signal. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Experiments in coherent spectroscopy correspond to control of quantum mechanical ensembles guiding them from initial to final target states. The control inputs (pulse sequences) that accomplish these transformations should be designed to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments. For example in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a question of fundamental importance is what is the maximum efficiency of coherence or polarization transfer between two spins in the presence of relaxation. Furthermore, what is the optimal pulse sequence which achieves this efficiency? In this paper, we give analytical answers to the above questions. Unexpected gains in sensitivity are reported for one of the most commonly used experimental building blocks in NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, in the case when longitudinal relaxation is small, the relaxation optimized pulse elements (ROPE) that transfer maximum polarization between coupled spins are longer than conventional sequences. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Examining neurometabolic abnormalities in critical brain areas in
schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD) may help guide future
pharmacological interventions including glutamate-modulating treatments.
Aims
To measure metabolite concentrations within the anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC) and thalamus of people with schizophrenia and people with
MDD.
Methods
Spectra were acquired from 16 volunteers with schizophrenia, 17 with MDD
and 18 healthy controls using magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 7
Tesla scanner.
Results
In the thalamus, there were lower glycine concentrations in the
schizophrenia group relative to control (P=0.017) and MDD groups
(P=0.012), and higher glutamine concentrations relative to healthy
controls (P=0.009). In the thalamus and the ACC, the MDD group had lower
myo-inositol concentrations than the control (P=0.014, P=0.009,
respectively) and schizophrenia (P=0.004, P=0.002, respectively) groups.
Conclusion
These results support the glutamatergic theory of schizophrenia and
indicate a potential glycine deficiency in the thalamus. In addition,
reduced myo-inositol concentrations in MDD suggest its involvement in
the disorder.

abstract = {90° and 180° universal rotation (UR) pulses are two of the most important classes of pulses in modern NMR spectroscopy. This article presents a systematic study characterizing the achievable performance of these pulses as functions of bandwidth, pulse length, and tolerance to B1-field inhomogeneity/miscalibration. After an evaluation of different quality factors employed in pulse design algorithms based on optimal control theory, resulting pulses are discussed in detail with a special focus on pulse symmetry. The vast majority of resulting BURBOP (broadband universal rotations by optimal control) pulses are either fully symmetric or have one symmetric and one antisymmetric Cartesian rf component, where the importance of the first symmetry has not been demonstrated yet and the latter one matches the symmetry that results from a previously derived construction principle of universal rotation pulses out of point-to-point pulses [3]. Optimized BURBOP pulses are shown to perform better than previously reported UR pulses, resulting in shorter pulse durations for the same quality of broadband rotations. From a comparison of qualities of effective universal rotations, we find that the application of a single optimal refocusing pulse matches or improves the performance of two consecutive inversion pulses in INEPT-like pulse sequence elements of the same total duration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Schizophrenia is characterized by loss of brain volume, which may represent an ongoing pathophysiological process. This loss of brain volume may be explained by reduced neuropil rather than neuronal loss, suggesting abnormal synaptic plasticity and cortical microcircuitry. A possible mechanism is hypofunction of the NMDA-type of glutamate receptor, which reduces the excitation of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, resulting in a disinhibition of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons. Disinhibition of pyramidal cells may result in excessive stimulation by glutamate, which in turn could cause neuronal damage or death through excitotoxicity. In this study, GABA/creatine ratios, and glutamate, NAA, creatine and choline concentrations in the prefrontal and parieto-occipital cortices were measured in 17 patients with schizophrenia and 23 healthy controls using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at an ultra-high magnetic field strength of 7 T. Significantly lower GABA/Cr ratios were found in patients with schizophrenia in the prefrontal cortex as compared to healthy controls, with GABA/Cr ratios inversely correlated with cognitive functioning in the patients. No significant change in the GABA/Cr ratio was found between patients and controls in the parieto-occipital cortex, nor were levels of glutamate, NAA, creatine, and choline differed in patients and controls in the prefrontal and parieto-occipital cortices. Our findings support a mechanism involving altered GABA levels distinguished from glutamate levels in the medial prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, particularly in high functioning patients. A (compensatory) role for GABA through altered inhibitory neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex may be ongoing in (higher functioning) patients with schizophrenia.},

While selecting where to grasp requires learning about the object as a whole, the execution only needs to reactively adapt to the context close to the grasp's location. We propose a hierarchical controller that reflects the structure of these two sub-problems, and attempts to learn solutions that work for both. A hybrid architecture is employed by the controller to make use of various machine learning methods that can cope with the large amount of uncertainty inherent to the task. The controller's upper level selects where to grasp the object using a reinforcement learner, while the lower level comprises an imitation learner and a vision-based reactive controller to determine appropriate grasping motions. The resulting system is able to quickly learn good grasps of a novel object in an unstructured environment, by executing smooth reaching motions and preshaping the hand depending on the object's geometry. The system was evaluated both in simulation and on a real robot. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The dynamics of a quantum system driven by an external field is well described by a unitary transformation generated by a time dependent Hamiltonian. The inverse problem of finding the field that generates a specific unitary transformation is the subject of study. The unitary transformation which can represent an algorithm in a quantum computation is imposed on a subset of quantum states embedded in a larger Hilbert space. Optimal control theory (OCT) is used to solve the inversion problem irrespective of the initial input state. A unified formalism, based on the Krotov method is developed leading to a new scheme. The schemes are compared for the inversion of a two-qubit Fourier transform using as registers the vibrational levels of the {\$}X{\^{}}1\backslashSigma{\^{}}+{\_}g{\$} electronic state of Na{\$}{\_}2{\$}. Raman-like transitions through the {\$}A{\^{}}1\backslashSigma{\^{}}+{\_}u{\$} electronic state induce the transitions. Light fields are found that are able to implement the Fourier transform within a picosecond time scale. Such fields can be obtained by pulse-shaping techniques of a femtosecond pulse. Out of the schemes studied the square modulus scheme converges fastest. A study of the implementation of the {\$}Q{\$} qubit Fourier transform in the Na{\$}{\_}2{\$} molecule was carried out for up to 5 qubits. The classical computation effort required to obtain the algorithm with a given fidelity is estimated to scale exponentially with the number of levels. The observed moderate scaling of the pulse intensity with the number of qubits in the transformation is rationalized.},

abstract = {Chemical shift is the phenomenon that is seen when an isotope possessing a nuclear magnetic dipole moment resonates at a spectrum of resonance frequencies in a given magnetic field. These resonance frequencies, or chemical shifts, depend on the chemical environments of particular nuclei. Mapping the spatial distribution of nuclei associated with a particular chemical shift (e.g., hydrogen nuclei associated with water molecules or with lipid groups) is called chemical shift imaging. Several techniques of proton chemical shift imaging that have been applied in vivo are presented, and their clinical findings are reported and summarized. Acquiring high-resolution spectra for large numbers of volume elements in two or three dimensions may be prohibitive because of time constraints, but other methods of imaging lipid of water distributions (i.e., selective excitation, selective saturation, or variations in conventional magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequences) can provide chemical shift information. These techniques require less time, but they lack spectral information. Since fat deposition seen by chemical shift imaging may not be demonstrated by conventional magnetic resonance imaging, certain applications of chemical shift imaging, such as in the determination of fatty liver disease, have greater diagnostic utility than conventional magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, edge artifacts caused by chemical shift effects can be eliminated by certain selective methods of data acquisition employed in chemical shift imaging.},

abstract = {In many global optimization problems motivated by engineering applications, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. To ensure that each evaluation contributes to the localization of good candidates for the role of global minimizer, a sequential choice of evaluation points is usually carried out. In particular, when Kriging is used to interpolate past evaluations, the uncertainty associated with the lack of information on the function can be expressed and used to compute a number of criteria accounting for the interest of an additional evaluation at any given point. This paper introduces minimizer entropy as a new Kriging-based criterion for the sequential choice of points at which the function should be evaluated. Based on $\backslash$emph{\{}stepwise uncertainty reduction{\}}, it accounts for the informational gain on the minimizer expected from a new evaluation. The criterion is approximated using conditional simulations of the Gaussian process model behind Kriging, and then inserted into an algorithm similar in spirit to the $\backslash$emph{\{}Efficient Global Optimization{\}} (EGO) algorithm. An empirical comparison is carried out between our criterion and $\backslash$emph{\{}expected improvement{\}}, one of the reference criteria in the literature. Experimental results indicate major evaluation savings over EGO. Finally, the method, which we call IAGO (for Informational Approach to Global Optimization) is extended to robust optimization problems, where both the factors to be tuned and the function evaluations are corrupted by noise.},

abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

The potential gain by optimal control using relaxation parameters against time-optimal control is explored and exemplified in numerical and in algebraic terms: it is the method of choice to govern quantum systems within subspaces of weak relaxation whenever the drift Hamiltonian would otherwise drive the system through fast decaying modes. In a standard model system generalising decoherence-free subspaces to more realistic scenarios, openGRAPE-derived controls realise a CNOT with fidelities beyond 95{\%} instead of at most 15{\%} for a standard Trotter expansion. As additional benefit it requires control fields orders of magnitude lower than the bang-bang decouplings in the latter.},

Analysis is performed in the time domain using non-negative least squares, and a new method for applying soft constraints to signal amplitudes is used to improve fitting stability. Initial point truncation and Hankel singular value decomposition water removal are used to reduce baseline interference. Three methods were used to test performance. First, metabolite concentrations from six healthy volunteers at 3 T were compared with LCModel™. Second, a Monte-Carlo simulation was performed and results were compared with LCModel™ to test the accuracy of the new method. Finally, the new algorithm was applied to 1956 spectra, acquired clinically at 1.5 T, to test robustness to noisy, abnormal, artifactual, and poorly shimmed spectra. Discrepancies of less than approximately 20{\%} were found between the main metabolite concentrations determined by TARQUIN and LCModel™ from healthy volunteer data. The Monte-Carlo simulation revealed that errors in metabolite concentration estimates were comparable with LCModel™. TARQUIN analyses were also found to be robust to clinical data of variable quality. In conclusion, TARQUIN has been shown to be an accurate and robust algorithm for the analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy data making it suitable for use in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Spatial localization techniques are necessary for in vivo NMR spectroscopy involving heterogeneous organisms. Localization by surface coil NMR detection alone is generally inadequate for deep-lying organs due to contaminating signals from intervening surface tissues. However, localization to preselected planar volumes can be accomplished using a single selective excitation pulse in the presence of a pulsed magnetic field gradient, yielding depth-resolved surface coil spectra (DRESS). Within selected planes, DRESS are spatially restricted by the surface coil sensitivity profiles to disk-shaped volumes whose radii increase with depth, notwithstanding variations in the NMR signal density distribution. Nevertheless, DRESS is a simple and versatile localization procedure that is readily adaptable to spectral relaxation time measurements by adding inversion or spin-echo refocusing pulses or to in vivo solvent-suppressed spectroscopy of proton (1H) metabolites using a combination of chemical-selective RF pulses. Also, the spatial information gathering efficiency of the technique can be improved to provide simultaneous acquisition of spectra from multiple volumes by interleaving excitation of adjacent planes within the normal relaxation recovery period. The spatial selectivity can be improved by adding additional selective excitation spin-echo refocusing pulses to achieve full, three-dimensional point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) in a single excitation sequence. Alternatively, for samples with short spin-spin relaxation times, DRESS can be combined with other localization schemes, such as image-selected in vivo spectroscopy (ISIS), to provide complete gradient controlled three-dimensional localization with a reduced number of sequence cycles.},

We formalize this task as a multiarmed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low norm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze an intuitive Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal in- formation gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

The quantization axis for the nuclear spin differs from the static B0 field direction and depends on the state of the electron spin. The quantization axis can be switched by flipping the state of electron spin, allowing for universal control of nuclear spin states. We show that by performing a sequence of flips (each followed by a suitable delay), we can perform any desired rotation of the nuclear spin, which can also be conditioned on the state of the electron spin. These operations, combined with electron spin rotations, can be used to synthesize any unitary transformation of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. We discuss how these methods can be used for design of experiments for transfer of polarization from the electron to the nuclear spins.},

The second part presents a more detailed discussion of the general theory and of a wide variety of experiments. The book stresses the use of SAS to provide hands-on solutions for the construction of designs in both standard and non-standard situations. The mathematical theory of the designs is developed in parallel with their construction in SAS, so providing motivation for the development of the subject. Many chapters cover self-contained topics drawn from science, engineering and pharmaceutical investigations, such as response surface designs, blocking of experiments, designs for mixture experiments and for nonlinear and generalized linear models. Understanding is aided by the provision of "SAS tasks" after most chapters as well as by more traditional exercises and a fully supported website.

One important class of algorithms is sequential update algorithms, generally attributed to Krotov. Although widely and often successfully used, the associated theory is often involved and leaves many crucial questions unanswered, from the monotonicity and convergence of the algorithm to discretization effects, leading to the introduction of ad hoc penalty terms and suboptimal update schemes detrimental to the performance of the algorithm. We present a general framework for sequential update algorithms including specific prescriptions for efficient update rules with inexpensive dynamic search length control, taking into account discretization effects and eliminating the need for ad hoc penalty terms. The latter, despite being necessary for regularizing the problem in the limit of infinite time resolution, i.e. the continuum limit, are shown to be undesirable and unnecessary in the practically relevant case of finite time resolution. Numerical examples show that the ideas underlying many of these results extend even beyond what can be rigorously proved.},

Constraints on the control field introduce local minima in the landscape --traps-- which might prevent an efficient solution of the optimal control problem. The Chopped Random Basis (CRAB) optimal control algorithm is constructed to improve the optimization efficiency by introducing an expansion of the control field onto a truncated basis, that is, it works with a limited control field bandwidth. We study the influence of traps on the success probability of CRAB and extend the original algorithm to engineer the landscape in order to eliminate the traps; we demonstrate that this development exploits the advantages of both (unconstrained) gradient algorithms and of truncated basis methods. Finally, we characterize the behavior of the extended CRAB under additional constraints and show that for reasonable constraints the convergence properties are still maintained.},

Such models can be improved in a beautification step, which finds geometric regularities approximately present in the model and imposes a consistent subset of them on the model. Methods to select regularities consistently such that they are likely to represent the original, ideal design intent are presented. Efficiency during selection is achieved by considering degrees of freedom to analyse the solvability of constraint systems representing the regularities (without actually solving them). Priorities are used to select regularities in case of inconsistencies. The selected set of constraints is solved numerically and an improved model is rebuilt from the solution. Experiments show that the presented methods can beautify models by selecting consistent regularities and enforcing major intended regularities. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Quantum control can tackle the challenge of protecting quantum sensors from environmental noise, while leaving their strong coupling to the target field to be measured. As the compromise between these two conflicting requirements does not always have an intuitive solution, optimal control based on numerical search could prove very effective. Here we adapt optimal control theory to the quantum sensing scenario, by introducing a cost function that, unlike the usual fidelity of operation, correctly takes into account both the unknown field to be measured and the environmental noise. We experimentally implement this novel control paradigm using a Nitrogen Vacancy center in diamond, finding improved sensitivity to a broad set of time varying fields. The demonstrated robustness and efficiency of the numerical optimization, as well as the sensitivity advantaged it bestows, will prove beneficial to many quantum sensing applications.},

abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used L k norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the L k norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

abstract = {Introduction: Spectral simulation is an effective and efficient means for optimizing data acquisition sequences and for facilitating spectral analysis. The VeSPA-Versatile Simulation, Pulses and Analysis package is an integrated set of open source applications written in that enables users to 1) synthesize RF pulses, 2) explore MRS data acquisition scenarios using multi-parametric spectral simulation and 3) improve MRS data processing/analysis from GE and Siemens scanners. Software and Methods: The VeSPA project is written in Python which, when combined with Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib modules, form the basis for an open source, free, replacement for IDL or Matlab. The applications in VeSPA are called RFPulse, Simulation and Analysis and are integrated through the use of a SQLite database (standard in the Python distribution) that allows them to share MR data objects and results. The applications are based on the adaptation and extension of three previous programs, MatPulse [1], GAVA [2] and SITools [3], respectively. Scientific functionality has been ported and extended into the new project while creating a common infrastructure to contain it that is easier to access and maintain (no licensing), simpler to extend (open source, BSD license) and has a consistent style across applications and platforms to ease learning curves. At the heart of Simulation is the GAMMA [4] spectral simulation library. GAMMA is a powerful C++ library, which can be used to describe and simulate NMR experiments. To facilitate usability, VeSPA has wrapped this resource using SWIG [5] so that its objects can be accessed directly from Python, without the need to compile spectral simulations externally. Results and Discussion: The three figures show (from top to bottom) 1) development of an SLR pulse in RFPulse application, 2) stack plots, peak integral plots and peak area contour plots for a STEAM simulation with a matrix of 32x32 TExTM values and three metabolites (shown is the glutamate peak integral around 2.4ppm) in the Simulation application, and 3) a short TE and a long TE single voxel PRESS data set and their difference (top, middle, bottom) in the Analysis application. In all cases, more than one pulse/simulation/dataset can be opened and displayed side-by-side. Other significant functionality not shown are: RFPulse -pulse concatenation, rescaling, pole inversion, and export into graphical and manufacturer specific formats; Simulation -a 'pulse sequence' design GUI, full database management dialogs, output to graphical and manufacturer data formats (LC Model, Siemens MetaboliteReport); Analysis -HLSVD signal analysis (for water/lipid removal, etc.), reference deconvolution, metabolite leasts squares basis model fitting iterated with wavelet baseline estimation. In all applications, results can be shared between VeSPA users via an XML import and export. The applications synergize one another. Pulses from RFPulse can be used as building blocks for Simulation pulse sequences, and spectral simulation results could be used in Analysis as part of the data processing or metabolite fitting (fit results not shown in figure). VeSPA application results are accessed by other applications via MR results object browsers from the SQLite database. There are a variety of predefined algorithms for RF pulse design and pulse sequence definitions that come with VeSPA. Software download and PDF and online documentation available at},

In rat brain, improved resolution was achieved by shimming all first- and second-order shim coils using a fully adiabatic FASTMAP sequence. The spectra showed a clear improvement in spectral resolution for all metabolite resonances with increased field strength. Changes in cerebral glutamine content were clearly observed at 4 T compared to 1.5 T in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. At 9.4 T, glutamine H4 at 2.46 ppm was fully resolved from glutamate H4 at 2.37 ppm, as was the potential resonance from gamma-amino-butyric acid at 2.30 ppm and N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate at 2.05 ppm. Singlet linewidths were found to be as low as 6 Hz (0.015 ppm) at 9.4 T, indicating a substantial decrease in ppm linewidth with field strength. Furthermore, the methylene peak of creatine was partially resolved from phosphocreatine, indicating a close to 1:1 relationship in gray matter. We conclude that increasing the magnetic field strength increases spectral resolution also for 1H NMR, which can lead to more than linear sensitivity gains.},

The lack of a readily available, consistent, robust, and easy-to-use shim algorithm can arguably be considered the greatest impediment to the application of 1 H-MRS as a standard diagnostic tool in the clinical imaging environment. Currently, several shim algorithms have been proposed, the most well-known being the FASTMAP based techniques (1-3), but to our knowledge, none have been tested for their utilitarian capability across multiple brain regions. Here, we test and compare three shim techniques in single-voxel spectroscopy: FASTESTMAP (3), GRESHIM (4), and the standard vendor-offered shim product. Methods: All measurements were performed on a clinical 3T scanner (Siemens Tim Trio, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel phased-array head coil and under an IRB protocol. A total of twenty-one spectra were acquired from five different participants over six different brain regions: anterior cingulate, two from posterior cingulate for repeatibility assessment, Broca's area, hippocampus, and the thalamus. The FASTESTMAP sequence was implemented as described in (3). Briefly, an adiabatic localization scheme was used to excite and refocus spins along narrow bars, and data from three orthogonal bars aligned with the three physical gradient axes were collected. One-dimensional frequency profiles were generated along each of the excited bars (2), and then used to estimate the required changes in shim currents to achieve a uniform B 0 field across the same voxel of interest (VOI) as used for the single-voxel spectroscopy acquisition. For GRESHIM (4), a field map was generated from a single-slab two-echo 3D GRE acquisition performed with two in-phase TEs for fat and water. Shim currents to improve B 0 homogeneity were calculated from the field map. As a reference, the standard vendor-offered product, advanced shim, was also investigated. The advanced shim technique uses a 3D dual-echo steady-state (DESS) gradient-echo sequence that acquires two signals within the same TR period, FISP and PSIF acquisitions. Advanced shim included an additional 3D phase map, but with opposite gradient polarity for eddy current correction. After eddy current correction, a 3D field map was generated from the two echoes for the calculation of the shim currents. For our experiment, the order in which shim techniques were applied were randomized for each volunteer. Immediately following each shim technique, spectra were acquired using a short TE STEAM sequence (TE/TM/TR = 10/12/3000 ms, number of excitations = 120, bandwidth = 2500 Hz, and vector size = 2048). The performance of each shim technique was evaluated by measuring the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the in-phase unsuppressed water peak through fitting with a Voight line shape. Visual inspection of the water suppressed spectra provided a qualitative assessment of the perfomance of the different shim algorithms. Results: Across the six brain regions studied, FASTESTMAP and GRESHIM performed similarly (Table 1.), providing high quality shims in four regions: centrum semiovale, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate and Broca's area, and acceptable quality in the hippocampus. All three shim techniques failed in the thalamus region, providing unacceptably poor quality spectra. A simple comparison of spectra from the different brain regions suggests 7-Hz as the maximum line width for high quality spectra, and a maximum of approximately 10-Hz for acceptable but lower quality spectra. Discussion: The most obvious effects of shim quality are SNR and resolution, which are visually demonstrated in Figs. 1A and 1B. For example, in Broca's area, relative to FASTESTMAP and GRESHIM, the {\textgreater}1.5-Hz shim increase in line width for the advanced shim acquisition of the water peak translates to a 13{\%} reduction in its SNR. Furthermore, for the advanced shim, the loss in resolution subsequently reduced the ability to resolve the two dominant glutamate C-4 peaks in water-suppressed spectra (Fig. 1B, arrow). Our analysis shows that FASTESTMAP and GRESHIM are comparable for single-voxel 1 H-MRS. The primary advantage of FASTESTMAP appears to be its relatively short scan time, {\~{}}12 s, versus 60 s for GRESHIM. However, for challenging regions, such as the hippocampus or Broca's area, FASTESTMAP required multiple iterations that actually extended the time beyond the acquisition time of GRESHIM. The main advantage of GRESHIM is its large shim slab that allows multiple spectroscopy scans without the need to repeat the shim acquisition. In practice, this advantage may be negated by patient motion between scans. With further integration into the vendor product platform, FASTESTMAP and GRESHIM shim techniques should provide reliable high-quality 1 H-MRS as a standard diagnostic tool in the clinical imaging environment. Conclusion: FASTESTMAP and GRESHIM are robust automated shim techniques that should greatly improve the reliability of clinical spectroscopy.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Markovian and non-Markovian environments are compared and efficient optimization algorithms utilizing analytic gradient expressions and quasi-Newton updates are given for both cases. The performance of the algorithms is analysed for a large set of problems in terms of the fidelities attained and the observed convergence behaviour. New notions of success rate and success speed are introduced and density plots are utilized to study the effects of key parameters, such as gate operation times, and random variables such as the initial fields required to start the iterative algorithm. Core characteristics of the optimal fields are analysed statistically. Substantial differences between Markovian and non-Markovian environments in terms of the possibilities for control and the control mechanisms are uncovered. In the non-Markovian case, gate fidelities improve substantially when the details of the system bath coupling are taken into account, although imperfections such as field leakage can be a significant problem. In the Markovian case, computation time is saved if the fields are pre-optimized neglecting the environment, while including the latter generally does not significantly improve gate fidelities.},

Moreover, the common framework is kept sufficiently general and allows for setting up gradient flows on (sub-)manifolds, Lie (sub-)groups, quotient groups, and reductive homogeneous spaces. Relevant convergence conditions are discussed meant to serve as justification for recent and new achievements, and as foundation for further research. Exploiting the differential geometry of quantum dynamics under different scenarios helps to provide highly useful algorithms: (a) On an abstract level, gradient flows may establish the exact upper bounds of pertinent quality functions, i.e. upper bounds reachable within the underlying manifold of the state space dynamics; (b) in a second stage referring to a concrete experimental setting, gradient flows on the manifold of piecewise constant control amplitudes {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbackslashR{\{}\backslash{\^{}}{\{}{\}}{\}}m{\{}{\$}{\}} may be set up to provide (approximations to) optimal control of quantum devices under realistic conditions.

abstract = {Quantum spin networks overcome the challenges of traditional charge-based electronics by encod-ing the information into spin degrees of freedom. Although beneficial for transmitting information with minimal losses when compared to their charge-based counterparts, the mathematical formal-ization of the information propagation in a spin(tronic) network is challenging due to its complicated scaling properties. In this paper, we propose a geometric approach—specific to finite networks—for unraveling the information-theoretic phenomena of spin chains and rings by abstracting them as weighted graphs, where the vertices correspond to the spin excitation states and the edges represent the information theoretic distance between pair of nodes. The weighted graph representation of the quantum spin network dynamics exhibits a complex self-similar structure (where subgraphs repeat to some extent over various space scales). To quantify this complex behavior, we develop a new box counting inspired algorithm which assesses the mono-fractal versus multi-fractal properties of quantum spin networks. Besides specific to finite networks, multi-fractality is further compounded by " engineering " or " biaising " the network for selective transfer, as selectivity makes the network more heterogeneous. To demonstrate criticality in finite size systems, we define a thermodynamics inspired framework for describing information propagation and show evidence that some spin chains and rings exhibit an informational phase transition phenomenon, akin to the metal-to-insulator phase transition in Anderson localization in finite media.},

First, we show that discretizing continuous control functions as piecewise-constant functions prevents high accuracy optimization at reasonable computational costs. Second, we argue that the number of control parameters required is on-par with the dimension of the object manipulated, and therefore one may choose parametrization by other considerations, e.g. experimental suitability and the potential for physical insight into the optimized pulse. Third, we note that optimal control algorithms which make use of the gradient of the goal function with respect to control parameters are generally faster and reach higher final accuracies than non gradient-based methods. Thus, if the gradient can be efficiently computed, it should be used. Fourth, we present a novel way of computing the gradient based on an equation of motion for the gradient, which we evolve in time by the Taylor expansion of the propagator. This allows one to calculate any physically relevant analytic controls to arbitrarily high precision. The combination of the above techniques is GOAT (Gradient Optimization of Analytic conTrols) - gradient-based optimal control for analytic control functions, utilizing exact evolution in time of the derivative of the propagator with respect to arbitrary control parameters.},

abstract = {Glutamatergic abnormalities in corticostriatal brain circuits are thought to underlie obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Whether these abnormalities exist in adults with OCD is not clear. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H MRS) to test our hypothesis that unmedicated adults with OCD have reduced glutamate plus glutamine (Glx) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared with healthy controls. Levels of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were also explored. Twenty-four unmedicated adults with OCD and 22 matched healthy control subjects underwent 1 H MRS scans at 3.0 T. Resonances of both Glx and GABA were obtained using the standard J-editing technique and assessed as ratios relative to voxel tissue water (W) in the MPFC (the region of interest) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to explore the regional specificity of any finding. In the MPFC, Glx/W did not differ by diagnostic group (p0.98) or sex (p0.57). However, GABA/W was decreased in OCD (2.16±0.46 × 10 3) compared with healthy controls (2.43±0.45 × 10 3, p0.045); moreover, age of OCD onset was inversely correlated with MPFC GABA/W (r0.50, p0.015). MPFC GABA/W was higher in females than in males. In the DLPFC, there were no main effects of diagnosis or gender on Glx/W or GABA/W. These data indicate that unmedicated adults with OCD do not have Glx abnormalities in a MPFC voxel that includes the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. However, they may have decreased MPFC GABA levels. How GABA abnormalities might contribute to corticostriatal dysfunction in OCD deserves further study. {\textcopyright} 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.},

abstract = {Aim: Development of MRI sequences and processing methods for the production of images appropriate for direct use in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment planning. Background: MRI is useful in SRS treatment planning, especially for patients with brain lesions or anatomical targets that are poorly distinguished by CT, but its use requires further refinement. This methodology seeks to optimize MRI sequences to generate distortion-free and clinically relevant MR images for MRI-only SRS treatment planning. Materials and methods: We used commercially available SRS MRI-guided radiotherapy phantoms and eight patients to optimize sequences for patient imaging. Workflow involved the choice of correct MRI sequence(s), optimization of the sequence parameters, evaluation of image quality (artifact free and clinically relevant), measurement of geometrical distortion, and evaluation of the accuracy of our offline correction algorithm. Results: CT images showed a maximum deviation of 1.3 mm and minimum deviation of 0.4 mm from true fiducial position for SRS coordinate definition. Interestingly, uncorrected MR images showed maximum deviation of 1.2 mm and minimum of 0.4 mm, comparable to CT images used for SRS coordinate definition. After geometrical correction, we observed a maximum deviation of 1.1 mm and minimum deviation of only 0.3 mm. Conclusion: Our optimized MRI pulse sequences and image correction technique show promising results; MR images produced under these conditions are appropriate for direct use in SRS treatment planning.},

The MR parameters were compared to those at 1.5 T. As expected, the T2 relaxation time constants and quantitative MT parameters (MT exchange rate, R, macromolecular pool fraction, M0B, and macromolecular T2 relaxation time, T2B) at 3 T were similar to those at 1.5 T. The T1 relaxation time values, however, for all measured tissues increased significantly with field strength. Consequently, the phenomenological MT parameter, magnetization transfer ratio, MTR, was lower by approximately 2 to 10{\%}. Collectively, these results provide a useful reference for optimization of pulse sequence parameters for MRI at 3 T.},

Spectroscopic imaging data may be obtained following contrast-enhanced MRI by applying the point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS) or the stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence from the MR voxel encompassing the breast lesion. Total choline signal (tCho) measured in vivo using either a qualitative or quantitative approach has been used as a diagnostic test in the workup of malignant breast lesions. In addition to tCho metabolites, other relevant metabolites, including multiple lipids, can be detected and monitored. MRS has been heavily investigated as an adjunct to morphologic and dynamic MRI to improve diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer, obviating unnecessary benign biopsies. Besides its use in the staging of breast cancer, other promising applications have been recently investigated, including the assessment of treatment response and therapy monitoring.

abstract = {A new matrix product, called the semi-tensor product (STP), is briefly reviewed. The STP extends the classical matrix product to two arbitrary matrices. Under STP the set of matrices becomes a monoid (semi-group with identity). Some related structures and properties are investigated. Then the generalized matrix addition is also introduced, which extends the classical matrix addition to a class of two matrices with different dimensions. Motivated by STP of matrices, two kinds of equivalences of matrices (including vectors) are introduced, which are called matrix equivalence (M-equivalence) and vector equivalence (V-equivalence) respectively. The lattice structure has been established for each equivalence. Under each equivalence, the corresponding quotient space becomes a vector space. Under M-equivalence, many algebraic, geometric, and analytic structures have been posed to the quotient space, which include (i) lattice structure; (ii) inner product and norm (distance); (iii) topology; (iv) a fiber bundle structure, called the discrete bundle; (v) bundled differential manifold; (vi) bundled Lie group and Lie algebra. Under V-equivalence, vectors of different dimensions form a vector space {\$}{\{}\backslashcal V{\}}{\$}, and a matrix {\$}A{\$} of arbitrary dimension is considered as an operator (linear mapping) on {\$}{\{}\backslashcal V{\}}{\$}. When {\$}A{\$} is a bounded operator (not necessarily square but includes square matrices as a special case), the generalized characteristic function, eigenvalue and eigenvector etc. are defined. In one word, this new matrix theory overcomes the dimensional barrier in certain sense. It provides much more freedom for using matrix approach to practical problems.},

abstract = {Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in brain. Our knowledge of the glutamatergic synapse has advanced enormously in the last 10 years, primarily through application of molecular biological techniques to the study of glutamate receptors and transporters. There are three families of ionotropic receptors with intrinsic cation permeable channels [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate]. There are three groups of metabotropic, G protein-coupled glutamate receptors (mGluR) that modify neuronal and glial excitability through G protein subunits acting on membrane ion channels and second messengers such as diacylglycerol and cAMP. There are also two glial glutamate transporters and three neuronal transporters in the brain. Glutamate is the most abundant amino acid in the diet. There is no evidence for brain damage in humans resulting from dietary glutamate. A kainate analog, domoate, is sometimes ingested accidentally in blue mussels; this potent toxin causes limbic seizures, which can lead to hippocampal and related pathology and amnesia. Endogenous glutamate, by activating NMDA, AMPA or mGluR1 receptors, may contribute to the brain damage occurring acutely after status epilepticus, cerebral ischemia or traumatic brain injury. It may also contribute to chronic neurodegeneration in such disorders as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's chorea. In animal models of cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury, NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists protect against acute brain damage and delayed behavioral deficits. Such compounds are undergoing testing in humans, but therapeutic efficacy has yet to be established. Other clinical conditions that may respond to drugs acting on glutamatergic transmission include epilepsy, amnesia, anxiety, hyperalgesia and psychosis.},

abstract = {The control of quantum dynamics via specially tailored laser pulses is a long-standing goal in physics and chemistry. Partly, this dream has come true, as sophisticated pulse shaping experiments allow to coherently control product ratios of chemical reactions. The theoretical design of the laser pulse to transfer an initial state to a given final state can be achieved with the help of quantum optimal control theory (QOCT). This tutorial provides an introduction to QOCT. It shows how the control equations defining such an optimal pulse follow from the variation of a properly defined functional. We explain the most successful schemes to solve these control equations and show how to incorporate additional constraints in the pulse design. The algorithms are then applied to simple quantum systems and the obtained pulses are analyzed.

Our method exploits sequential Monte Carlo to produce a fast sequential design algorithm for these models relative to the estab-lished MCMC alternative. The latter is less ideal for sequential design since it must be restarted and iterated to convergence with the inclusion of each new design point. We illustrate some attractive ensemble aspects of our SMC approach, and show how active learning heuristics may be implemented via particles to optimize a noisy func-tion or to explore classification boundaries online.

abstract = {Long echo time (TE = 270 ms) in vivo proton NMR spectra resembling human brain metabolite patterns were simulated for lineshape fitting (LF) and quantitative artificial neural network (ANN) analyses. A set of experimental in vivo 1H NMR spectra were first analyzed by the LF method to match the signal-to-noise ratios and linewidths of simulated spectra to those in the experimental data. The performance of constructed ANNs was compared for the peak area determinations of choline-containing compounds (Cho), total creatine (Cr), and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) signals using both manually phase-corrected and magnitude spectra as inputs. The peak area data from ANN and LF analyses for simulated spectra yielded high correlation coefficients demonstrating that the peak areas quantified with ANN gave similar results as LF analysis. Thus, a fully automated ANN method based on magnitude spectra has demonstrated potential for quantification of in vivo metabolites from long echo time spectroscopic imaging. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science.},

abstract = {Optimal control approaches have proved useful in designing RF pulses for large tip-angle applications. A typical challenge for optimal control design is the inclusion of constraints resulting from physiological or technical limitations that assure the realizability of the optimized pulses. In this paper, we show how to treat such inequality constraints, in particular, amplitude constraints on the B1 field, the slice-selective gradient, and its slew rate, as well as constraints on the slice profile accuracy. For the latter, a pointwise profile error and additional phase constraints are prescribed. Here, a penalization method is introduced that corresponds to a higher order tracking instead of the common quadratic tracking. The order is driven to infinity in the course of the optimization. We jointly optimize for the RF and slice-selective gradient waveform. The amplitude constraints on these control variables are treated efficiently by semismooth Newton or quasi-Newton methods. The method is flexible, adapting to many optimization goals. As an application, we reduce the power of refocusing pulses, which is important for spin echo-based applications with a short echo spacing. Here, the optimization method is tested in numerical experiments for reducing the pulse power of simultaneous multislice refocusing pulses. The results are validated by phantom and in-vivo experiments.},

The highest creatine levels are found in cerebellum, parallel to the distribution of creatine kinase and energy-requiring processes in the brain. Also myo-inositol has highest concentrations in the cerebellum. Choline-containing compounds exhibit a marked regional variability with again highest concentrations in cerebellum and lowest levels and a strong caudally decreasing gradient in gray matter.

abstract = {Glutamate is the most abundant free amino acid in the brain and is at the crossroad between multiple metabolic pathways. Considering this, it was a surprise to discover that glutamate has excitatory effects on nerve cells, and that it can excite cells to their death in a process now referred to as "excitotoxicity". This effect is due to glutamate receptors present on the surface of brain cells. Powerful uptake systems (glutamate transporters) prevent excessive activation of these receptors by continuously removing glutamate from the extracellular fluid in the brain. Further, the blood-brain barrier shields the brain from glutamate in the blood. The highest concentrations of glutamate are found in synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals from where it can be released by exocytosis. In fact, glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. It took, however, a long time to realize that. The present review provides a brief historical description, gives a short overview of glutamate as a transmitter in the healthy brain, and comments on the so-called glutamate-glutamine cycle. The glutamate transporters responsible for the glutamate removal are described in some detail. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).},

Many conditions are known to exhibit a disturbance in Glu-Gln equilibrium, and the exact relationships between these changed conditions and these amino acids are not fully understood. This has led to increased interest in Glu/Gln quantitation in the human brain in an array of conditions (e.g. mental illness, tumor, neuro-degeneration) as well as in normal brain function. Accordingly, this review has been undertaken to describe the increasing number of in vivo techniques available to study Glu and Gln separately, or pooled as 'Glx'. The present MRS methods used to assess Glu and Gln vary in approach, complexity, and outcome, thus the focus of this review is on a description of MRS acquisition approaches, and an indication of relative utility of each technique rather than brain pathologies associated with Glu and/or Gln perturbation. Consequently, this review focuses particularly on (1) one-dimensional 1H MRS, (2) two-dimensional 1H MRS, and (3) one-dimensional 13C MRS techniques. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one dis-tribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length represen-tations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

abstract = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mam-malian brain, can induce coma. Outside the central nervous system it is synthesized by gut bac-teria and catabolized largely in the liver. GABA and its agonists, as well as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, induce neural inhibition as a consequence of their interaction with specific binding sites for each of these classes of neuroactive substances on the GABA receptor complex of postsynaptic neurons. In a rabbit model of acute liver failure: (i) the pattern of postsynaptic neuronal activity in hepatic coma, as assessed by visual evoked potentials, is identical to that associated with coma induced by drugs which activate the GABA neurotransmitter system (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and GABA agonists); (ii) the levels of GABA-like activity in peripheral blood plasma increase appreciably before the onset of hepatic encephalopathy, due at least in part to impaired hepatic extraction of gut-derived GABA from portal venous blood; (iii) the blood-brain barrier becomes abnormally permeable to an isomer of GABA, a-amino-isobutyric acid, before the onset of hepatic encephalopathy; and (iv) hepatic coma is associated with an increase in the density of receptors for GABA and benzodiazepines in the brain. These findings are the bases of the following hypotheses: (i) when the liver fails, gut-derived GABA in plasma crosses an abnormally permeable blood-brain barrier and by mediating neural inhibi-tion contributes to hepatic encephalopathy; (ii) an increased number of GABA receptors in the brain found in liver failure increases the sensitivity of the brain to GABA-ergic neural inhibi-tion; and (iii) an increased number of drug binding sites mediates the increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and barbiturates observed in liver failure by permitting increased drug effect.},

Results: Metabolite identification between the 6- and 38-min protocols was comparable in phantom and volunteer data. For metabolites with Cramer–Rao lower bounds {\textgreater} 50{\%}, interpretation of JPRESS increased confidence in assignment of lactate, myo-Inositol and scyllo-Inositol. JPRESS also showed promise for the detection of glycine and taurine in paediatric brain tumours when compared to short-TE MRS.

The authors describe a chemical shift selective (CHESS) imaging technique which destroys the unwanted signal component by means of a selective 90 degrees excitation pulse and a subsequent magnetic field gradient ('homogeneity spoiling gradient') prior to imaging of the wanted component.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce a new toolkit for simulation and processing of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data, and to demonstrate some of its novel features.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The FID appliance (FID-A) is an open-source, MATLAB-based software toolkit for simulation and processing of MRS data. The software is designed specifically for processing data with multiple dimensions (eg, multiple radiofrequency channels, averages, spectral editing dimensions). It is equipped with functions for importing data in the formats of most major MRI vendors (eg, Siemens, Philips, GE, Agilent) and for exporting data into the formats of several common processing software packages (eg, LCModel, jMRUI, Tarquin). This paper introduces the FID-A software toolkit and uses examples to demonstrate its novel features, namely 1) the use of a spectral registration algorithm to carry out useful processing routines automatically, 2) automatic detection and removal of motion-corrupted scans, and 3) the ability to perform several major aspects of the MRS computational workflow from a single piece of software. This latter feature is illustrated through both high-level processing of in vivo GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS data, as well as detailed quantum mechanical simulations to generate an accurate LCModel basis set for analysis of the same data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All of the described processing steps resulted in a marked improvement in spectral quality compared with unprocessed data. Fitting of MEGA-PRESS data using a customized basis set resulted in improved fitting accuracy compared with a generic MEGA-PRESS basis set.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The FID-A software toolkit enables high-level processing of MRS data and accurate simulation of in vivo MRS experiments.

Design: Laboratory study using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) and behavioral testing. Setting: VA Medical Center Research Service, Psychiatry and Radiology. Patients or Participants: Twenty-seven patients with PTSD (PTSD+) and 18 trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (PTSD?), recruited from United States Army reservists, Army National Guard, and mental health clinics. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: 1H MRS at 4 Tesla yielded spectra from three cortical brain regions. In parieto-occipital and temporal cortices, PTSD+ had lower GABA concentrations than PTSD?. As expected, PTSD+ had higher depressive and anxiety symptom scores and a higher Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. Higher ISI correlated with lower GABA and higher glutamate levels in parieto-occipital cortex and tended to correlate with lower GABA in the anterior cingulate. The relationship between parieto-occipital GABA and PTSD diagnosis was fully mediated through insomnia severity. Lower N-Acetylaspartate and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex correlated with higher arousal scores, whereas depressive and anxiety symptoms did generally not influence metabolite concentrations. Conclusions: Low brain gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is consistent with most findings in panic and social anxiety disorders. Low GABA associated with poor sleep quality is consistent with the hyperarousal theory of both primary insomnia and PTSD. Our data demonstrate that poor sleep quality mediates low parieto-occipital GABA in PTSD. The findings have implications for PTSD treatment approaches.},

abstract = {The MEGA-PRESS method is the most common method used to measure $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain at 3T. It has been shown that the underestimation of the GABA signal due to B0 drift up to 1.22 Hz/min can be reduced by post-frequency alignment. In this study, we show that the underestimation of GABA can still occur even with post frequency alignment when the B0 drift is up to 3.93 Hz/min. The underestimation can be reduced by applying a frequency shift threshold. A total of 23 subjects were scanned twice to assess the short-term reproducibility, and 14 of them were scanned again after 2-8 weeks to evaluate the long-term reproducibility. A linear regression analysis of the quantified GABA versus the frequency shift showed a negative correlation (P {\textless} 0.01). Underestimation of the GABA signal was found. When a frequency shift threshold of 0.125 ppm (15.5 Hz or 1.79 Hz/min) was applied, the linear regression showed no statistically significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Therefore, a frequency shift threshold at 0.125 ppm (15.5 Hz) can be used to reduce underestimation during GABA quantification. For data with a B0 drift up to 3.93 Hz/min, the coefficients of variance of short-term and long-term reproducibility for the GABA quantification were less than 10{\%} when the frequency threshold was applied.},

It gives an overview of several basic and advanced topics in machine learning theory. The book is definitely valuable to scientists and engineers who are involved in developing machine learning tools applied to signal and image processing applications. This book is also suitable for courses on machine learning and pattern recognition, designed for advanced undergraduates or PhD students. No previous knowledge of machine learning concepts or algorithms is assumed, but readers need some knowledge of calculus and linear algebra. The book is complemented by a great deal of additional supports for instructors and students. The supports include solutions to the exercises in each chapter, the example data sets used throughout the book and the forthcoming companion book that deals with practical and software implementations of the key algorithms. A strong point of this book is that the mathematical expressions or algorithms are usually accompanied with colorful graphs and figures. This definitely helps to communicate the concepts much better to the students or the interested researchers than pure description of the algorithms. The book also provides an interesting short biography of the key scientists and mathematicians who have contributed historically to the basic mathematical concepts and methods in each chapter.$\backslash$n},

Herein a standard vectorial description is presented for the mechanism of this artifact, which results from the chemical shift between homonuclear scalar-coupled (i.e., J coupled) nuclei. The chemical shift causes the extent of a signal phase modulation to vary for different spatial regions of the excited voxel. This variation results in spatial interference effects that can lead to marked loss of signal intensity as well as corruption of the size and shape of the voxel from which signal is obtained. The phenomenon is substantial at an imaging field of 1.5 T and becomes especially pronounced at higher field strengths. Several strategies to avoid the artifact are provided.},

abstract = {Purpose: Many tools exist for quantifying magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. Literature comparing them is sparse but indicates potential methodological bias. We benchmark MRS analysis tools to elucidate this. Methods: Four series of phantom experiments, including both solutions and tissue-mimicking gels, with constant concentrations of NAA, Creatine, Glutamine and Glutamate, and iteratively increased concentrations of GABA are performed. MEGA-PRESS spectra are acquired and quantified with several state-of-the-art MRS analysis tools (LCModel, TARQUIN, JMRUI, GANNET) and in-house code (LWFIT). GABA-to-NAA ratios for reported metabolite amplitudes are compared to the ground truth of known concentration ratios. Overall estimation accuracy is assessed by linear fits of reported vs. actual ratios and coefficients of determination. Simulations further elucidate the experimental results. Results: Significant differences in reported GABA-to-NAA amplitude ratios are observed. TARQUIN consistently overestimates, while most tools underestimate ratios to varying degrees compared to the ground truth. Underestimationdue to reduced editing efficiency is predicted by simulations. LCModel performs comparatively well for well-resolved solution spectra but struggles for intentionally miscalibrated spectra and gel spectra mimicking in-vivo conditions. GANNET shows better consistency and robustness to calibration errors but greater underestimation related to how the 3 ppm GABA peak is fitted. Surprisingly, simple peak integration with minimal pre-processing yields the most consistent and accurate results compared to the ground truth. Conclusions: A methodological dependence is observed not only in the quantification results for individual spectra, but in GABA-to-NAA gradients across experimental series, systematic offsets and coefficients of determination.},

abstract = {Spectral editing allows direct measurement of low-concentration metabolites, such as GABA, glutathione (GSH) and lactate (Lac), relevant for understanding brain (patho)physiology. The most widely used spectral editing technique is MEGA-PRESS, which has been diversely implemented across research sites and vendors, resulting in variations in the final resolved edited signal. In this paper, we describe an effort to develop a new universal MEGA-PRESS sequence with HERMES functionality for the major MR vendor platforms with standardized RF pulse shapes, durations, amplitudes and timings. New RF pulses were generated for the universal sequence. Phantom experiments were conducted on Philips, Siemens, GE and Canon 3 T MRI scanners using 32-channel head coils. In vivo experiments were performed on the same six subjects on Philips and Siemens scanners, and on two additional subjects, one on GE and one on Canon scanners. On each platform, edited MRS experiments were conducted with the vendor-native and universal MEGA-PRESS sequences for GABA (TE = 68 ms) and Lac editing (TE = 140 ms). Additionally, HERMES for GABA and GSH was performed using the universal sequence at TE = 80 ms. The universal sequence improves inter-vendor similarity of GABA-edited and Lac-edited MEGA-PRESS spectra. The universal HERMES sequence yields both GABA- and GSH-edited spectra with negligible levels of crosstalk on all four platforms, and with strong agreement among vendors for both edited spectra. In vivo GABA+/Cr, Lac/Cr and GSH/Cr ratios showed relatively low variation between scanners using the universal sequence. In conclusion, phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate successful implementation of the universal sequence across all four major vendors, allowing editing of several metabolites across a range of TEs.},

Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized.

As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.},

abstract = {We present a local optimal control strategy to produce desired unitary transformations. Unitary transformations are central to all quantum computational algorithms. Many realizations of quantum computation use a submanifold of states, comprising the quantum register, coupled by an external driving field to a collection of additional mediating excited states. Previous attempts to apply control theory to induce unitary transformations on the quantum register, while successful, produced pulses that drive the population out of the computational register at intermediate times. Leakage of population from the register is undesirable since often the states outside the register are prone to decay and decoherence, and populating them causes a decrease in the final fidelity. In this work we devise a local optimal control method for achieving target unitary transformations on a quantum register, while avoiding intermediate leakage out of the computational submanifold. The technique exploits a phase locking of the field to the system such as to eliminate the undesirable excitation. This method is then applied to produce an SU(6) Fourier transform on the vibrational levels of the ground electronic state of the Na{\$}{\_}2{\$} molecule. The emerging mechanism uses two photon resonances to create a transformation on the quantum register while blocking one photon resonances to excited states.},

This problem is very old; it arises when Kronecker products of spin operators and spatial dynamics generators are taken—the resulting matrices are far too large for any current or future computer. However, spin and spatial operators individually have manageable dimensions, and we note here that the action by their Kronecker products on any vector may be computed without opening those products. This eliminates large matrices from the simulation process. MRI simulations for coupled spin systems of complex metabolites in three dimensions with diffusion, flow, chemical kinetics, and quantum mechanical treatment of spin relaxation are now possible.

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community.

Relating these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules.

Despite these successes, the approach is restricted to problems of moderate dimension, and several workshops on Bayesian optimization have identified its scaling to high-dimensions as one of the holy grails of the field. In this paper, we introduce a novel random embedding idea to attack this problem. The resulting Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) algorithm is very simple, has important invariance properties, and applies to domains with both categorical and continuous variables. We present a thorough theoretical analysis of REMBO. Empirical results confirm that REMBO can effectively solve problems with billions of dimensions, provided the intrinsic dimensionality is low. They also show that REMBO achieves state-of-the-art performance in optimizing the 47 discrete parameters of a popular mixed integer linear programming solver.},

abstract = {Accelerated magnetic resonance (MR) scan acquisition with compressed sensing (CS) and parallel imaging is a powerful method to reduce MR imaging scan time. However, many reconstruction algorithms have high computational costs. To address this, we investigate deep residual learning networks to remove aliasing artifacts from artifact corrupted images. The proposed deep residual learning networks are composed of magnitude and phase networks that are separately trained. If both phase and magnitude information are available, the proposed algorithm can work as an iterative k-space interpolation algorithm using framelet representation. When only magnitude data is available, the proposed approach works as an image domain post-processing algorithm. Even with strong coherent aliasing artifacts, the proposed network successfully learned and removed the aliasing artifacts, whereas current parallel and CS reconstruction methods were unable to remove these artifacts. Comparisons using single and multiple coil show that the proposed residual network provides good reconstruction results with orders of magnitude faster computational time than existing compressed sensing methods. The proposed deep learning framework may have a great potential for accelerated MR reconstruction by generating accurate results immediately.},

Since then, this hypothesis has been extended to describe how glutamate abnormalities may disturb brain function and underpin psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairments. The glutamatergic system is now a major focus for the development of new compounds in schizophrenia. Relationships between regional brain glutamate function and symptom severity can be investigated using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to estimate levels of glutamatergic metabolites in vivo. Here we briefly review the 1H-MRS studies that have explored relationships between glutamatergic metabolites, symptoms, and cognitive function in clinical samples. While some of these studies suggest that more severe symptoms may be associated with elevated glutamatergic function in the anterior cingulate, studies in larger patient samples selected on the basis of symptom severity are required. {\textcopyright} 2013 Merritt, McGuire and Egerton.},

abstract = {The dynamical behavior of open quantum systems plays a key role in many applications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems, such as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in many-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum transport, quantum chemistry and quantum information. In close analogy to a classical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a noisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator in Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an irreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many applications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of genuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations. Here, recent results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are discussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition, to the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the quantification of memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series of examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system dynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new perspective for applications, namely to exploit a small open system as a quantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is interacting with. This article further explores the various physical sources of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured spectral densities, nonlocal correlations between environmental degrees of freedom and correlations in the initial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their local detection. Recent experiments on the detection, quantification and control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives are determine the optimal combination of MR parameters for discriminating tumour within the prostate using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and to compare model accuracy with that of an experienced radiologist. METHODS: Multiparameter MRIs in 24 patients before prostatectomy were acquired. Tumour outlines from whole-mount histology, T2-defined peripheral zone (PZ), and central gland (CG) were superimposed onto slice-matched parametric maps. T2, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient, initial area under the gadolinium curve, vascular parameters (K(trans),Kep,Ve), and (choline+polyamines+creatine)/citrate were compared between tumour and non-tumour tissues. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined sensitivity and specificity at spectroscopic voxel resolution and per lesion, and LDA determined the optimal multiparametric model for identifying tumours. Accuracy was compared with an expert observer. RESULTS: Tumours were significantly different from PZ and CG for all parameters (all p {\textless} 0.001). Area under the ROC curve for discriminating tumour from non-tumour was significantly greater (p {\textless} 0.001) for the multiparametric model than for individual parameters; at 90 {\%} specificity, sensitivity was 41 {\%} (MRSI voxel resolution) and 59 {\%} per lesion. At this specificity, an expert observer achieved 28 {\%} and 49 {\%} sensitivity, respectively. CONCLUSION: The model was more accurate when parameters from all techniques were included and performed better than an expert observer evaluating these data. KEY POINTS: • The combined model increases diagnostic accuracy in prostate cancer compared with individual parameters • The optimal combined model includes parameters from diffusion, spectroscopy, perfusion, and anatominal MRI • The computed model improves tumour detection compared to an expert viewing parametric maps.},

The chosen design criteria were transformation of Iz ??? Ix over resonance offsets of ??20kHz and RF variability of ??5{\%}, with a pulse length of 2ms. Simulations of the resulting pulse transform Iz ??? 0.995Ix over the target ranges in resonance offset and RF variability.

abstract = {Objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common and highly disabling disease characterized by substantial cognitive and functional impairment. The exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying the expression of symptoms in this condition remain unknown but there is growing evidence that glutamate might play an important role. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), a number of studies have examined brain glutamate/glutamine levels in patients with bipolar disorder, but they have produced conflicting results. The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on brain glutamate/glutamine in BD as measured by 1H-MRS. Methods: A Medline search for the period January 1980-April 2010 was conducted to identify published studies that used 1H-MRS to measure glutamate+glutamine (Glx), the Glx/creatine (Cr) ratio, glutamate (Glu), or the Glu/Cr ratio in any brain region in adult or child/adolescent patients with BD and healthy subjects. A meta-analysis of the pooled data was conducted. Results: BD patients were found to have increased Glx compared to healthy subjects when all brain areas were combined. This finding remained true in medicated and non-medicated patients, and in frontal brain areas in adults. There was a non-significant trend (p=0.09) for an increase in whole-brain Glx/Cr and Glu in patients compared with healthy subjects. No significant difference was found in Glu/Cr. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that brain Glx levels are elevated in BD patients and support the idea that glutamate might play an important role in the pathophysiology of BD. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley and Sons A/S.},

MEGA, a frequency-selective refocusing technique, can be placed into any pulse sequence element designed to generate a Hahn spin-echo or stimulated echo, to dephase transverse water coherences with minimal spectral distortions. Water suppression performance was verified in vivo using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) localization, which provided water suppression comparable with that achieved with four selective pulses in 3,1-DRYSTEAM. The advantage of the proposed method was exploited for editing J-coupled resonances. Using a double-banded pulse that selectively inverts a J-coupling partner and simultaneously suppresses water, efficient metabolite editing was achieved in the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and STEAM sequences in which MEGA was incorporated. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, the detection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was demonstrated, with minimal contributions from macromolecules and overlying singlet peaks at 4 T. The estimated occipital GABA concentration was consistent with previous reports, suggesting that editing for GABA is efficient when based on MEGA at high field strengths.},

abstract = {The implementation of fault-tolerant quantum gates on encoded logic qubits is considered. It is shown that transversal implementation of logic gates based on simple geometric control ideas is problematic for realistic physical systems suffering from imperfections such as qubit inhomogeneity or uncontrollable interactions between qubits. However, this problem can be overcome by formulating the task as an optimal control problem and designing efficient algorithms to solve it. In particular, we can find solutions that implement all of the elementary logic gates in a fixed amount of time with limited control resources for the five-qubit stabilizer code. Most importantly, logic gates that are extremely difficult to implement using conventional techniques even for ideal systems, such as the T-gate for the five-qubit stabilizer code, do not appear to pose a problem for optimal control.},

abstract = {Individual differences in anxiety provide a differential predisposition to develop neuropsychiatric disorders. The neurochemical underpinnings of anxiety remain elusive, particularly in deep structures, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) whose involvement in anxiety is being increasingly recognized. We examined the associations between the neurochemical profile of human NAc metabolites involved in neural excitation and inhibition and inter-individual variation in temperamental and situational anxiety. Twenty-seven healthy 20–30 years-old human males were phenotyped with questionnaires for state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI), social anxiety (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale), negative mood (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI) and fatigue (Mental and Physical State Energy and Fatigue Scales, SEF). Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS) at 7 Tesla (7T), we measured metabolite levels for glutamate, glutamine, GABA and taurine in the NAc. Salivary cortisol was also measured. Strikingly, trait anxiety was negatively associated with NAc taurine content. Perceived situational stress was negatively associated with NAc GABA, while positively with the Glu/GABA ratio. No correlation was observed between NAc taurine or GABA and other phenotypic variables examined (i.e., state anxiety, social anxiety, negative mood, or cortisol), except for a negative correlation between taurine and state physical fatigue. This first 7T study of NAc neurochemistry shows relevant metabolite associations with individual variation in anxiety traits and situational stress and state anxiety measurements. The novel identified association between NAc taurine levels and trait anxiety may pave the way for clinical studies aimed at identifying new treatments for anxiety and related disorders.},

An accurate estimation of spectral parameters allows for better assessment of spectral quality and metabolite concentration levels. The current gold standard quantification method is the LCModel - a commercial fitting tool. However, this fails for spectra having poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or a large number of artifacts. This paper introduces a framework based on random forest regression for accurate estimation of the output parameters of a model based analysis of MR spectroscopy data. The goal of our proposed framework is to learn the spectral features from a training set comprising of different variations of both simulated and in-vivo brain spectra and then use this learning for the subsequent metabolite quantification. Experiments involve training and testing on simulated and in-vivo human brain spectra. We estimate parameters such as concentration of metabolites and compare our results with that from the LCModel.},

A mixture of l1- and l∞-norms of the current density, when used as a regularisation term in the field synthesis problem, was found to produce coils with bunches of equally spaced windings that do not take up all of the available surface.

Methods: Using density matrix simulations, a PRESS sequence with (TE1, TE2) = (69, 37) ms and an inserted 90° J-suppression pulse were found to minimize the NAA multiplet at 2.49 ppm. Results: NAA phantom experiments confirmed the successful suppression of the NAA multiplet at 2.49 ppm. A study of eight healthy volunteers found both Glu and Gln to be significantly higher in gray matter (GM) dominant medial prefrontal cortex voxels than in white matter (WM) dominant right frontal cortex voxels. Time-course 1H spectra acquired during intravenous [U-13C6]glucose infusion showed gradually changing Glu C4 and Gln C4 proton resonance signals in a spectral pattern predicted by numerical simulations. Conclusion: Reliable detection of Glu, Gln, and GSH was achieved. Glu and Gln levels were significantly higher in frontal lobe GM than in frontal lobe WM. It is feasible to use the proposed proton MR spectroscopy method to measure the kinetics of 13C incorporation into Glu and Gln during infusion of 13C labeled glucose.},

In particular, when H acts on n qubits, has at most a constant number of nonzero entries in each row/column, and |H| is bounded by a constant, we may select any positive integer {\$}k{\$} such that the simulation requires O(($\backslash$log{\^{}}*n)t{\^{}}{\{}1+1/2k{\}}) accesses to matrix entries of H.

abstract = {Modern high resolution NMR spectrometers employ the Fourier transform method where the entire spectrum is uniformly excited by a "hard" radiofrequency pulse. Occasionally, information is more easily extracted by an experiment where the excitation is selective in the frequency domain, using a "soft" radiofrequency pulse. We may select a single transition, an entire spin multiplet or an extended range of chemical shift frequencies for the excitation. In the early experiments, simple rectangular-shaped pulses were used, but much better results can be achieved by suitably shaping the envelope of the pulse. Several interesting schemes have been explored for designing pulse shapes, including simulated annealing, computer-simulated neural networks and evolutionary strategies that mimic the processes of natural selection. Selective pulse excitation has been used for relaxation time measurements, solvent peak suppression, resolution enhancement, separation of overlapping two-dimensional multiplets, improving the definition of fine structure in two-dimensional spectroscopy, and for reducing the time penalty associated with three- or four-dimensional NMR. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Partly, this dream has come true, as sophisticated pulse shaping experiments allow to coherently control product ratios of chemical reactions. The theoretical design of the laser pulse to transfer an initial state to a given final state can be achieved with the help of quantum optimal control theory (QOCT). This tutorial provides an introduction to QOCT. It shows how the control equations defining such an optimal pulse follow from the variation of a properly defined functional. We explain the most successful schemes to solve these control equations and show how to incorporate additional constraints in the pulse design. The algorithms are then applied to simple quantum systems and the obtained pulses are analyzed. Besides the traditional final-time control methods, the tutorial also presents an algorithm and an example to handle time-dependent control targets.},

We propose a probabilistic generative model and inference procedures for NMR spectroscopy. Specifically, we use a weighted sum of trigonometric functions undergoing exponential decay to model free induction decay (FID) signals. We discuss the challenges in estimating the components of this general model -- amplitudes, phase shifts, frequencies, decay rates, and noise variances -- and offer practical solutions. We compare with conventional Fourier transform spectroscopy for estimating the relative concentrations of chemicals in a mixture, using synthetic and experimentally acquired FID signals. We find the proposed model is particularly robust to low signal to noise ratios (SNR), and overlapping peaks in the Fourier transform of the FID, enabling accurate predictions (e.g., 1{\%} sensitivity at low SNR) which are not possible with conventional spectroscopy (5{\%} sensitivity).},

abstract = {Spin-echo-based acquisitions are the workhorse of clinical MRI because they provide a variety of useful image contrasts and are resistant to image artifacts from radio-frequency or static field inhomogeneity. Three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions provide datasets that can be retrospectively reformatted for viewing in freely selectable orientations, and are thus advantageous for evaluating the complex anatomy associated with many clinical applications of MRI. Historically, however, 3D spin-echo-based acquisitions have not played a significant role in clinical MRI due to unacceptably long acquisition times or image artifacts associated with details of the acquisition method. Recently, optimized forms of 3D fast/turbo spin-echo imaging have become available from several MR-equipment manufacturers (for example, CUBE [GE], SPACE [Siemens], and VISTA [Philips]). Through specific design strategies and optimization, including short non-spatially selective radio-frequency pulses to significantly shorten the echo spacing and variable flip angles for the refocusing radio-frequency pulses to suppress blurring or considerably lengthen the useable duration of the spin-echo train, these techniques permit single-slab 3D imaging of sizeable volumes in clinically acceptable acquisition times. These optimized fast/turbo spin-echo pulse sequences provide a robust and flexible approach for 3D spin-echo-based imaging with a broad range of clinical applications. J. Magn. Reson.

abstract = {Developmental signalling pathways operate repeatedly to regulate remarkably tissue- and stage-specific transcriptional responses. Canonical Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling is such a key developmental pathway; however, while recruitment of nuclear $\beta$-catenin to target genomic loci serves as the hallmark of canonical Wnt signalling, mechanisms controlling context- specific transcriptional responses in different stages and tissues remain elusive. Here using the first direct comparison of genome-wide occupancy of $\beta$-catenin with a stage-matched Wnt-regulated transcriptome in early vertebrate embryos, we discover that just a subset of $\beta$-catenin-bound genomic loci are transcriptionally regulated by Wnt signalling. We further demonstrate that Wnt signalling regulates $\beta$-catenin binding to Wnt target genes not only in the developmental context in which they are transcriptionally regulated, but also in other contexts, where their transcription remains unaffected. Their transcriptional response to Wnt signalling is conditional on additional mechanisms, such as BMP or FGF signalling for the particular genes we investigated, which, however, do not influence $\beta$-catenin recruitment. In conclusion, our findings suggest a more general paradigm for Wnt-regulated transcriptional mechanisms, which is relevant for the repeated and tissue-specific functions of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling particularly in embryonic development, but also for stem-cell-mediated homeostasis and cancer. Chromatin-association of $\beta$-catenin, even to functional Wnt response elements, can no longer be considered a proxy for identifying transcriptional Wnt target genes. Context-dependent mechanisms are crucial for transcriptional activation of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin target genes subsequent to $\beta$-catenin recruitment. Our conclusions therefore imply that Wnt-regulated $\beta$-catenin binding in one context can mark Wnt-regulated transcriptional target genes for different contexts.},

However, several problems arise when making use of autonomous moving robots for EM. The main challenges are how to build an accurate spatial-temporal model while choosing locations for measuring the phenomenon. This paper addresses the problem by using Bayesian Optimisation for choosing sensing locations, and presents a new utility function that takes into account the distance travelled by a moving robot. The proposed methodology is tested in simulation and in a real environment. Compared to existing strategies, our approach exhibits slightly better accuracy in terms of RMSE error and considerably reduces the total distance travelled by the robot.},

abstract = {Early-life stress and biological predispositions are linked to mood and personality disorders related to aggressive behavior. We previously showed that exposure to peripubertal stress leads to increased anxiety-like behaviors and aggression against males and females, as well as increased aggression against females in their male offspring. Here, we investigated whether paternal (pS) and individual (iS) exposure to peripubertal stress may exert additive effects on the long-term programming of anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors in rats. Given the key role of the lateral septum (LS) in the regulation of anxiety and aggressive behaviors and the hypothesized alterations in balance between neural excitation and inhibition in aggression-related disorders, markers for these processes were examined in the LS. Peripubertal stress was applied both in na{\"{i}}ve male rats and in the offspring of peripubertally stressed males, and anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors were assessed at adulthood. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 6-months, and post-mortem analysis of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) at 12-months were conducted in LS. We confirmed that aggressive behavior was increased by pS and iS, while only iS increased anxiety-like behavior. Individual stress led to reduced GABA, confirmed by reduced GAD67 immunolabelling, and increased glutamate, N-acetyl-aspartate, phosphocholine and creatine; while pS specifically led to reduced phosphocreatine. pS and iS do not interact and exert a differential impact on the analyzed aspects of brain function and anxiety-like behaviors. These data support the view that early-life stress can affect the behavioral and neurodevelopmental trajectories of individuals and their offspring, which may involve different neurobiological mechanisms.},

The study focused mainly on the influence of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and different linewidths on the accuracy and precision of the quantification results, and their effectiveness in accounting for the broad signal contribution of macromolecules and lipids (often called the baseline in in vivo MRS). When applied in their standard configuration (i.e., fitting a spline as a baseline for LCModel, and weighting the first data points for AMARES), both methods performed comparably but with their own characteristics. LCModel and AMARES quantitation benefited considerably from the incorporation of baseline information into the prior knowledge. However, the more accurate quantitation of the sum of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) favored the use of LCModel. Metabolite-to-creatine ratios estimated by LCModel with extended prior knowledge are more accurate than absolute concentrations, and are nearly independent of SNR and line broadening. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Proton MRS ( 1 H MRS) provides noninvasive, quantitative metabolite profiles of tissue and has been shown to aid the clinical management of several brain diseases. Although most modern clinical MR scanners support MRS capabilities, routine use is largely restricted to specialized centers with good access to MR research support. Widespread adoption has been slow for several reasons, and technical challenges toward obtaining reliable good-quality results have been identified as a contributing factor. Considerable progress has been made by the research community to address many of these challenges, and in this paper a consensus is presented on deficiencies in widely available MRS methodology and validated improvements that are currently in routine use at several clinical research institutions. In particular, the localization error for the PRESS localization sequence was found to be unacceptably high at 3 T, and use of the semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing sequence is a recommended solution. Incorporation of simulated metabolite basis sets into analysis routines is recommended for reliably capturing the full spectral detail available from short TE acquisitions. In addition, the importance of achieving a highly homogenous static magnetic field (B 0 ) in the acquisition region is emphasized, and the limitations of current methods and hardware are discussed. Most recommendations require only software improvements, greatly enhancing the capabilities of clinical MRS on existing hardware. Implementation of these recommendations should strengthen current clinical applications and advance progress toward developing and validating new MRS biomarkers for clinical use.},

This circumvents the computational issues that arise due to the number of basis functions required to span a "sufficiently rich" subspace of the space of scalar observables in these problems. We illustrate this method on the FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE, a prototypical example of a one-dimensional reaction diffusion system, and compare our results with related methods such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) that have the same computational cost as our approach. In this example, the resulting approximations of the leading Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes are both more accurate and less sensitive to the distribution of the data used in the computation than those produced by DMD.},

abstract = {Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes has become an increasingly popular tool in the machine learning community. It is efficient and can be used when very little is known about the objective function, making it popular in expensive black-box optimization scenarios. It uses Bayesian methods to sample the objective efficiently using an acquisition function which incorporates the model's estimate of the objective and the uncertainty at any given point. However, there are several different parameterized acquisition functions in the literature, and it is often unclear which one to use. Instead of using a single acquisition function, we adopt a portfolio of acquisition functions governed by an online multi-armed bandit strategy. We propose several portfolio strategies, the best of which we call GP-Hedge, and show that this method outperforms the best individual acquisition function. We also provide a theoretical bound on the algorithm's performance.},

abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors normally expressed in the central nervous system where they mediate neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and feedback inhibition of neurotransmitter release. However, recent data suggest that these receptors are also expressed and functional in some cancers, most notably melanoma. We detected the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 (gene: GRM1; protein: mGluR1) in triple negative breast cancer cells and evaluated its role in regulating the pro-proliferative phenotype of these cells. mGluR1 inhibitors (Riluzole or BAY36-7620) inhibited the proliferation of triple negative breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and this inhibition correlated with increased apoptosis as demonstrated by increase in PARP cleavage products and Annexin V staining. mGluR1 knockdown using Lentiviral constructs expressing shRNA targeting GRM1 also inhibited proliferation compared to non-silencing controls. In addition, treatment of mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts with Riluzole or BAY36-7620, by intraperitoneal injection, resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume of up to 80{\%}. Moreover, Riluzole was effective against triple negative breast cancer xenografts in mice at doses equivalent to those currently being used in humans for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our observations implicate mGluR1 and glutamate signaling as a promising new molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer. Even more promising, Riluzole, because it is an oral drug that can be administered with low toxicity, represents a promising approach in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an important technique in biomedical research and it has the unique capability to give a non-invasive access to the biochemical content (metabolites) of scanned organs. In the literature, the quantification (the extraction of the potential biomarkers from the MRS signals) involves the resolution of an inverse problem based on a parametric model of the metabolite signal. However, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), presence of the macromolecule signal or high correlation between metabolite spectral patterns can cause high uncertainties for most of the metabolites, which is one of the main reasons that prevents use of MRS in clinical routine. In this paper, quantification of metabolites in MR Spectroscopic imaging using deep learning is proposed. A regression framework based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is introduced for an accurate estimation of spectral parameters. The proposed model learns the spectral features from a large-scale simulated data set with different variations of human brain spectra and SNRs. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, compared to state of the art standard quantification method (QUEST), on concentration of 20 metabolites and the macromolecule.},

A common strategy is to place sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model. We propose a mutual information criteria, and show that it produces better placements. Furthermore, we prove that finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of our criterion. This algorithm is extended to handle local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on two real-world data sets.},

@inproceedings{MartinezCantin07RSS,
abstract = {This paper proposes a simulation-based active policy learning algorithm for finite-horizon, partially-observed sequential decision processes. The algorithm is tested in the domain of robot navigation and exploration under uncertainty. In such a setting, the expected cost, that must be minimized, is a function of the belief state (filtering distribution). This filtering distribution is in turn nonlinear and subject to discontinuities, which arise because constraints in the robot motion and control models. As a result, the expected cost is non-differentiable and very expensive to simulate. The new algorithm overcomes the first difficulty and reduces the number of required simulations as follows. First, it assumes that we have carried out previous simulations which returned values of the expected cost for different corresponding policy parameters. Second, it fits a Gaussian process (GP) regression model to these values, so as to approximate the expected cost as a function of the policy parameters. Third, it uses the GP predicted mean and variance to construct a statistical measure that determines which policy parameters should be used in the next simulation. The process is then repeated using the new parameters and the newly gathered expected cost observation. Since the objective is to find the policy parameters that minimize the expected cost, this iterative active learning approach effectively trades-off between exploration (in regions where the GP variance is large) and exploitation (where the GP mean is low). In our experiments, a robot uses the proposed algorithm to plan an optimal path for accomplishing a series of tasks, while maximizing the information about its pose and map estimates. These estimates are obtained with a standard filter for simultaneous localization and mapping. Upon gathering new observations, the robot updates the state estimates and is able to replan a new path in the spirit of open-loop feedback control. I.},

abstract = {The nature and value of various animal models of epilepsy for the study and understanding of the human epilepsies are reviewed, with special reference to the ILAE classification of seizures. Kindling as a model of complex-partial seizures with secondary generalisation is treated in detail, dwelling principally on the evidence that the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are centrally involved in the kindling process. Kindling in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus system and its relationship to LTP are analysed in detail. Changes in amino acid content in animal and human brain tissue following onset of the epileptic state are reviewed with special reference to glutamate and GABA. Studies of changes in the extent of basal and stimulus-evoked release of glutamate and GABA both in vivo (microdialysis) and in vitro (brain slices) are evaluated. This includes both kindling and other models of epilepsy, and microdialysis of human patients with epilepsy. Experiments which study the influence of pre-synaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors on glutamate release, and consequently on the extent of electrical kindling, are described. This pre-synaptic control of glutamate release can be studied using synaptosomes. The significance of the ability of focal intracerebrally injected glutamate and NMDA to cause (chemical) kindling and the strong sensitivity of this process to pre-treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists is analysed. Electrical and chemical kindling effects are additive, indicating the existence of mechanisms in common. They are both sensitive to NMDA antagonists and the common mechanism is probably NMDA receptor activation due to the presence of exogenous (chemical) or endogenous (electrically-released) extracellular glutamate. The participation of the NMDA receptor in the generation of the spontaneous hyperactivity which characterises the chronic epileptic state is reviewed. This includes the entry of Ca2+ to stimulate various post-synaptic phosphorylation processes, and possible modulation of NMDA receptor population size and sensitivity. The question of whether neurotransmitter glutamate is involved in initiation and/or spread of seizures is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The subjects comprised 15 patients with bipolar disorder type I (BD), 15 with schizophrenia (SCH), 15 with schizoaffective disorder (SAD) and 15 healthy controls. We performed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) bilaterally. Levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho) and creatine-containing compounds (Cr) were measured in the DLPFC using 1H-MRS. We administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Stroop Test (ST) to evaluate executive functions. The SAD, BD and SCH patients had lower levels of NAA than the control group. The SAD and BD patients had low levels of Cho compared to the control group. The left DLPFC Cr levels in all of the patient groups and the right DLPFC Cr levels in the BD and SAD groups were lower than in the control group. The levels of NAA Cho and Cr were not related to executive functions and attention performance. Cr level were related to attention processes, only in SCH. Our results indicate that NAA levels are reduced in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, but the reduction in the levels of NAA is not a distinctive feature among these three illnesses. Schizoaffective and bipolar disorders have similar features related to the levels of compounds containing Cho and Cr. This similarity may be related to these illnesses both having an affective basis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The 450K BeadChip does not include any methylation sites in the exact location as sites in candidate genes previously examined in the literature, so a test for replication of prior research findings was not feasible. RESULTS Methylation in 3 genes emerged as genome-wide-significant predictors of depression: DNA-Binding Protein Inhibitor ID-3 (ID3); Glutamate Receptor, Ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 1 (GRIN1); and Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP) (p {\textless} 5.0 × 10(-7), all analyses). These genes are all biologically relevant with ID3 involved in the stress response, GRIN1 involved in neural plasticity, and TPPP involved in neural circuitry development. Methylation in CpG sites in candidate genes were not predictors of depression at significance levels corrected for whole genome testing, but maltreated and control children did have significantly different $\beta$ values after Bonferroni correction at multiple methylation sites in these candidate genes (e.g., BDNF, NR3C1, FKBP5). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that epigenetic changes in ID3, GRIN1, and TPPP genes, in combination with experiences of maltreatment, may confer risk for depression in children. The study adds to a growing body of literature supporting a role for epigenetic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Although epigenetic changes are frequently long lasting, they are not necessarily permanent. Consequently, interventions to reverse the negative biological and behavioral sequelae associated with child maltreatment are briefly discussed.},

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter known to counterbalance the action of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Several pharmacologic agents target the GABA system and modulate the overall effect of GABA. This article highlights multiple neurobiological interactions that play a role in anxiety and reviews selected studies of plasma neurosteroid levels, plasma GABA levels, and benzodiazepine binding site sensitivity and density in patients with anxiety disorders. The article concludes with further support for the role of the GABA system in anxiety by summarizing the current evidence supporting the use of novel GABAergic agents including tiagabine in the treatment of anxiety disorders.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning a policy to adapt a system's controller based on the value of these external conditions in order to always perform well (i.e., maximize system output). In addition, we are concerned with systems for which it is expensive to run experiments, and therefore restrict the number that can be run during training. We formally define the problem setup and the notion of an optimal control policy. We propose two algorithms which aim to find such a policy while minimizing the number of system output evaluations. We present results comparing these algorithms and various other approaches and discuss the inherent tradeoffs in the proposed algorithms. Finally, we use these methods to train both simulated and physical snake robots to automatically adapt to changing terrain, and demonstrate improved performance on test courses with changing environments.},

abstract = {The eigenimage filter generates a composite image in which a desired feature is segmented from interfering features. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the eigenimage equals its contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and is directly proportional to the dissimilarity between the desired and interfering features. Since image gray levels are analytical functions of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, it is possible to maximize this dissimilarity by optimizing these parameters. For optimization, the authors consider four MRI pulse sequences: multiple spin-echo (MSE); spin-echo (SE); inversion recovery (IR); and gradient-echo (GE). The authors use the mathematical expressions for MRI signals along with intrinsic tissue parameters to express the objective function (normalized SNR of the eigenimage) in terms of MRI parameters. The objective function along with a set of diagnostic or instrumental constraints define a multidimensional nonlinear constrained optimization problem, which the authors solve by the fixed point approach. The optimization technique is demonstrated through its application to phantom and brain images. The authors show that the optimal pulse sequence parameters for a sequence of four MSE and one IR images almost doubles the smallest normalized SNR of the brain eigenimages, as compared to the conventional brain protocol.},

abstract = {Aim: This study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to evaluate the neurochemistry of the frontal cortex in adolescents with symptoms of sleep and depression. Methods: Nineteen non-medicated adolescent boys (mean age 16.0 years; 9 clinical cases with depression/sleep symptoms and 10 healthy controls) underwent 1H MRS at 3 T. MR spectra were acquired from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and frontal white matter. Concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate, total creatine, choline-containing compounds, total glutamine plus glutamate, and myo-inositol (mI) were compared in the 2 subgroups, and correlated with sleep and clinical measures in the total sample. Sleep was assessed with self-report questionnaires and ambulatory polysomnography recordings. Results: Concentrations of mI were lower in both frontal cortical regions among the depressed adolescents than in controls. No statistically significant differences in other metabolite concentrations were observed between the subgroups. Frontal cortex mI concentrations correlated negatively with depression severity, subjective daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, and the level of anxiety, and correlated positively with total sleep time and overall psychosocial functioning. The correlations between mI in the ACC and total sleep time as well as daytime sleepiness remained statistically significant when depression severity was controlled in the analyses. Conclusion: Lower frontal cortex mI may indicate a disturbed second messenger system. Frontal cortical mI may thus be linked to the pathophysiology of depression and concomitant sleep symptoms among maturing adolescents. Short sleep and daytime sleepiness may be associated with frontal cortex mI independently from depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Many robotic path planning applications, such as search and rescue, involve uncertain environments with complex dynamics that can be only partially observed. When selecting the best subset of ob- servation locations subject to constrained resources (such as limited time or battery capacity) it is an im- portant problem to trade off exploration (gathering information about the environment) and exploita- tion (using the current knowledge about the envi- ronment most effectively) for efficiently observing these environments. Even the nonadaptive setting, where paths are planned before observations are made, is NP-hard, and has been subject to much research. In this paper, we present a novel approach to adap- tive informative path planning that addresses this exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Our approach is nonmyopic, i.e. it plans ahead for possible obser- vations that can be made in the future. We quan- tify the benefit of exploration through the “adap- tivity gap” between an adaptive and a nonadaptive algorithm in terms of the uncertainty in the environ- ment. Exploiting the submodularity (a diminishing returns property) and locality properties of the ob- jective function, we develop an algorithm that per- forms provably near-optimally in settings where the adaptivity gap is small. In case of large gap, we use an objective function that simultaneously optimizes paths for exploration and exploitation. We also pro- vide an algorithm to extend any single robot algo- rithm for adaptive informative path planning to the multi robot setting while approximately preserving the theoretical guarantee of the single robot algo- rithm. We extensively evaluate our approach on a search and rescue domain and a scientific monitor- ing problem using a real robotic system},

The goals of this study were to develop an acquisition protocol and the analysis tools for Meshcher–Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) in mouse brain at 9.4 T, to allow the in vivo detection of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to examine whether isoflurane alters GABA levels in the thalamus during anesthesia. We implemented the MEGA-PRESS sequence on a Bruker 94/20 system with ParaVision 6.0.1, and magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from nine male wild-type C57BL/6 J mice at the thalamus. Four individual scans were obtained for each mouse in a 2-h time course whilst the mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane. We developed an automated analysis program with improved correction for frequency and phase drift compared with the standard creatine (Cr) fitting-based method and provided automatic quantification. During MEGA-PRESS acquisition, a single voxel with a size of 5 × 3 × 3 mm 3 was placed at the thalamus to evaluate GABA to Cr (GABA/Cr) ratios during anesthesia. Detection and quantitative analysis of thalamic GABA levels were successfully achieved. We noticed a significant decrease in GABA/Cr during the 2-h anesthesia (by linear regression analysis: slope  {\textless}  0, p  {\textless}  0.0001). In summary, our findings demonstrate that MEGA-PRESS is a feasible technique to measure in vivo GABA levels in the mouse brain at 9.4 T.},

abstract = {The sharpened No-Free-Lunch-theorem (NFL-theorem) states that, regardless of the performance measure, the performance of all optimization algorithms averaged uniformly over any finite set F of functions is equal if and only if F is closed under permutation (c.u.p.). In this paper, we first summarize some consequences of this theorem, which have been proven recently: The number of subsets c.u.p. can be neglected compared to the total number of possible subsets. In particular, problem classes relevant in practice are not likely to be c.u.p. The average number of evaluations needed to find a desirable (e.g., optimal) solution can be calculated independent of the optimization algorithm in certain scenarios. Second, as the main result, the NFL-theorem is extended. Necessary and sufficient conditions for NFL-results to hold are given for arbitrary distributions of target functions. This yields the most general NFL-theorem for optimization presented so far.},

It is a typical task amenable to numerical optimal control to turn the time course of pulses, i.e. piecewise constant control amplitudes, iteratively into an optimised shape. Here, we present the first comparative study of optimal control algorithms for a wide range of finite-dimensional applications. We focus on the most commonly used algorithms: GRAPE methods which update all controls concurrently, and KROTOV-type methods which do so sequentially. Guidelines for their use are given and open research questions are pointed out. --- Moreover we introduce a novel unifying algorithmic framework, DYNAMO (dynamic optimisation platform) designed to provide the quantum-technology community with a convenient MATLAB-based toolset for optimal control. In addition, it gives researchers in optimal-control techniques a framework for benchmarking and comparing new proposed algorithms to the state-of-the-art. It allows for a mix-and-match approach with various types of gradients, update and step-size methods as well as subspace choices.

@article{Jones:1993,
abstract = {We present a new algorithm for finding the global minimum of a multivariate function subject to simple bounds. The algorithm is a modification of the standard Lipschitzian approach that eliminates the need to specify a Lipschitz constant. This is done by carrying out simultaneous searches using all possible constants from zero to infinity. On nine standard test functions, the new algorithm converges in fewer function evaluations than most competing methods. The motivation for the new algorithm stems from a different way of looking at the Lipschitz constant. In particular, the Lipschitz constant is viewed as a weighting parameter that indicates how much emphasis to place on global versus local search. In standard Lipschitzian methods, this constant is usually large because it must equal or exceed the maximum rate of change of the objective function. As a result, these methods place a high emphasis on global search and exhibit slow convergence. In contrast, the new algorithm carries out simultaneous searches using all possible constants, and therefore operates at both the global and local level. Once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part of the algorithm quickly and automatically exploits it. This accounts for the fast convergence of the new algorithm on the test functions.},

Radio frequency pulses are used in coherent spectroscopy to implement a unitary transfer of state. Pulse sequences that accomplish a desired transfer should be as short as possible in order to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments. Here, we give an analytical characterization of such time optimal pulse sequences applicable to coherence transfer experiments in multiple-spin systems. We have adopted a general mathematical formulation, and present many of our results in this setting, mindful of the fact that new structures in optimal pulse design are constantly arising. Moreover, the general proofs are no more difficult than the specific problems of current interest. From a general control theory perspective, the problems we want to study have the following character. Suppose we are given a controllable right invariant system on a compact Lie group, what is the minimum time required to steer the system from some initial point to a specified final point? In NMR spectroscopy and quantum computing, this translates to, what is the minimum time required to produce a unitary propagator? We also give an analytical characterization of maximum achievable transfer in a given time for the two spin system.},

abstract = {Selective information transfer in spin ring networks by landscape shaping control has the property that the error 1 − prob, where prob is the transfer success probability, and the sensi-tivity of the probability to spin coupling errors are " positively correlated, " meaning that both are statistically increasing across a family of controllers of increasing error. Here, we examine the rank correlation between the error and another measure of performance—the logarithmic sensitivity—used in robust control to formulate the fundamental limitations. Contrary to error versus sensitivity, the error versus logarithmic sensitivity correlation is less obvious, because its weaker trend is made difficult to detect by the noisy behavior of the logarithmic sensitivity across controllers of increasing error numerically optimized in a challenging landscape. This results in the Kendall $\tau$ test for rank correlation between the error and the log sensitivity to be pessimistic with poor confidence. Here it is shown that the Jonckheere-Terpstra test, because it tests the Alternative Hypothesis of an ordering of the medians of some groups of log sensitivity data, alleviates this problem and hence singles out cases of anti-classical behavior of " positive correlation " between the error and the logarithmic sensitivity.},

@article{Mazzi2010,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the design of numerical methods for quantum simulation and the development of improved models for quantum relaxation. Analysis is presented for the treatment of quantum systems using the density matrix formalism. This approach has been developed from the early days of quantum mechanics as a tool to describe from a statistical point of view a large number of identical quantum ensembles. Traditional methods are well established and reliable, but they perform poorly for practical simulation as the system size is scaled up. Ad hoc schemes for nuclear spin dynamics appearing in the literature can be shown to fail in certain situations. The challenge is therefore to identify efficient reduction methods for the quantum system which are also based on a rigorous foundation. The method presented in the thesis, for the time–independent Hamiltonian case, combines a quantum density matrix formalism with a procedure based on Chebyshev polynomials; application of the method to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is considered, and it is shown that the new technique outperforms existing alternatives in term of computational costs. The case of a time–dependent Hamiltonian in NMR simulation is studied as well and some splitting methods are presented. To the author's knowledge this is the first time such methods have been applied within the NMR framework, and the numerical results show a better error–to–cost rate than traditional methods. In a separate strand of research, formulations for open quantum systems are studied and new dynamical systems approaches are considered for this problem. Motivations This thesis work is mainly focused on nuclear spin dynamics. Nuclear spin dynamics constitutes the basis for NMR, which is a very powerful spectroscopy technique that exploits the interaction between nuclear spins and magnetic fields. The same technique is used to reveal the presence of hydrogen atoms in the blood for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Within this framework the role of simulations is extremely important, as it provides a benchmark for studies of new materials, and the development of new magnetic fields. The main computational issue is that with current software for NMR simulation it is extremely expensive to deal with systems made of more than few (7–10) spins. There is therefore a strong need to develop new algorithms capable of simulating larger systems. In recent years NMR simulations have been found to be one of the most favorable candidates for quantum computing. There are two reasons for this: nuclear quantum states maintain extremely long coherences, and it is possible to attain a very strong control on the quantum state via the application of sequences of pulses. In order to develop a proper quantum computer it is fundamental to understand how the entangled states lose coherence and relax back to equilibrium by means of external interactions. This process is described as relaxation in an open quantum system. The theory for such systems has been available for 50 years but there are still substantial limitations in the two main approaches. There are also relatively few numerical approaches for the simulation of such systems, for this reason it is important to develop numerical alternatives for the description of open quantum systems. Thesis Outline The thesis is organized as follow: the first two chapters provide background material to familiarize the reader with fundamental concepts of both quantum mechanics and nuclear spin dynamics; in this part of the thesis no new results are presented. The first chapter introduces the concept of quantum systems and the mathematical environment with which we describe those systems. We also present the main equations we need to solve to determine the dynamics of a quantum system in a statistical framework. In the second chapter we introduce the nuclear spin system, that is the physical system that has been the main reference frame in this work, for both tests and practical applications of the new algorithms. We describe how nuclear spin systems are at the basis of very important applications like NMR spectroscopy and MRI. We present in some detail the physical features of the NMR technique and the equations we need to solve to describe the dynamics of a spin system; we also focus on the relevance of numerical simulations for these systems, and consequently which must be the interest in developing new algorithms, and the major obstacles which must be overcome. In the third chapter we investigate the numerical challenges that arise in simulation of quantum systems, we describe some of the methods that have been developed in the literature, focusing on the performances and the computational costs of them, setting the new developments of this thesis in the proper research frame. We discuss one of the major issues: the evaluation of the matrix exponential. We also present the analysis we have done of a recent method called Zero Track Elimination (ZTE) that has been developed specifically for NMR simulations. This analysis shows the limitations of this method but also gives a mathematical explanation of why–and in which cases–it works. In the fourth chapter we present the main result of the thesis, the development of a new method that directly evaluates the expectation values for a quantum simulation via a different application of the well known Chebyshev expansion. We have proved that this new method can provide an excellent boost in terms of performance, with computational costs that can be reduced by a factor ten in common cases. (The results of this chapter and the new method have been presented in international conferences and recently they have been submitted for publication). We also present some attempts we have made in the application of splitting methods for the evolution of the system in a time dependent environment. To our knowledge this is the first time splitting methods have been used for NMR simulations. The results of this approach are as follows: for a particular splitting technique combined with a Lanczos iteration method it is possible to speed up the calculation by a third if compared with a Lanczos type method whilst keeping the error below a critical threshold. This last approach is still a work in progress especially in terms of developing clever ways to split the Hamiltonian. The last chapter of this thesis deals with simulation of quantum systems interacting with an external environment. After presenting the main theoretical approaches for the description of such systems we then survey several the techniques that are currently used for the numerical implementation of such theories. As a work in progress we present a considerably different new approach we have been developing aiming to overcome some of the issues that arise when treating this kind of system within usual frameworks. This is somewhat speculative work that gives rise to some new directions in the development of a numerical description for open quantum systems. We also present some numerical results. (The main core of this chapter has been presented in international conferences).},

Two of the feature properties, local connectivity and weight sharing, can reduce the number of parameters and increase processing speed during training and inference. However, as the dimension of data becomes higher and the CNN architecture becomes more complicated, the end-to-end approach or the combined manner of CNN is computationally intensive, which becomes limitation to CNN's further implementation. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to implement CNN in a faster way. In this paper, we first summarize the acceleration methods that contribute to but not limited to CNN by reviewing a broad variety of research papers. We propose a taxonomy in terms of three levels, i.e. structure level, algorithm level, and implementation level, for acceleration methods. We also analyze the acceleration methods in terms of CNN architecture compression, algorithm optimization, and hardware-based improvement. At last, we give a discussion on different perspectives of these acceleration and optimization methods within each level. The discussion shows that the methods in each level still have large exploration space. By incorporating such a wide range of disciplines, we expect to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers who are interested in CNN acceleration.},

abstract = {Background: The mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) has received increasing attention, of which the diagnosis is challenging. To analyze the possible biomarkers for the early diagnosis, we investigated the metabolite changes in different brain regions of PD-MCI patients as well as appropriate controls by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Methods: The metabolism in the occipital lobe, posterior cingulate, substantia nigra and basal ganglia was studied in 66 PD-MCI patients, 70 cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN) and 74 healthy controls. Results: The N-acetylaspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio in the occipital lobe in PD-MCI patients was lower than that in healthy controls (P {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, the choline to creatine ratio in the posterior cingulate was higher in PD-MCI patients than in controls or PD-CN patients (both P {\textless} 0.05). No significant metabolite difference in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia was found. Furthermore, the decreases of the ratios of NAA/Cr in the occipital lobe were associated with PD-CN (P {\textless} 0.05) and PD-MCI (P {\textless} 0.0001) while the increase in the ratio of Cho/Cr in the posterior cingulate was associated with PD-MCI (P ≤ 0.01). Conclusion: The metabolite changes in the occipital lobe and posterior cingulate occur in the early cognitive impairment phase of PD patients. Such variations can be used as the marker for the detection of PD-MCI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose : This article proposes a rigorous optimal control framework for the design of preparation schemes that optimize MRI contrast based on relaxation time differences. Methods : Compared to previous optimal contrast preparation schemes, a drastic reduction of the optimization parameter number is performed. The preparation scheme is defined as a combination of several block pulses whose flip angles, phase terms and inter-pulse delays are optimized to control the magnetization evolution. Results : The proposed approach reduces the computation time of B0-robust preparation schemes to around a minute (whereas several hours were required with previous schemes), with negligible performance loss. The chosen parameterization allows to formulate the total preparation duration as a constraint, which improves the overall compromise between contrast performance and preparation time. Simulation, in vitro and in vivo results validate this improvement, illustrate the straightforward applicability of the proposed approach, and point out its flexibility in terms of achievable contrasts. Major improvement is especially achieved for short-T2 enhancement, as shown by the acquisition of a non-trivial contrast on a rat brain, where a short-T2 white matter structure (corpus callosum) is enhanced compared to surrounding gray matter tissues (hippocampus and neocortex). Conclusions : This approach proposes key advances for the design of optimal contrast preparation sequences, that emphasize their ability to generate non-standard contrasts, their potential benefit in a clinical context, and their straightforward applicability on any MR system.},

abstract = {Methods of optimal control are applied to a model system of interacting two-level particles (e.g., spin-half atomic nuclei or electrons or two-level atoms) to produce high-fidelity quantum gates while simultaneously negating the detrimental effect of decoherence. One set of particles functions as the quantum information processor, whose evolution is controlled by a time-dependent external field. The other particles are not directly controlled and serve as an effective environment, coupling to which is the source of decoherence. The control objective is to generate target one- and two-qubit unitary gates in the presence of strong environmentally-induced decoherence and under physically motivated restrictions on the control field. The quantum-gate fidelity, expressed in terms of a novel state-independent distance measure, is maximized with respect to the control field using combined genetic and gradient algorithms. The resulting high-fidelity gates demonstrate the feasibility of precisely guiding the quantum evolution via optimal control, even when the system complexity is exacerbated by environmental coupling. It is found that the gate duration has an important effect on the control mechanism and resulting fidelity. An analysis of the sensitivity of the gate performance to random variations in the system parameters reveals a significant degree of robustness attained by the optimal control solutions.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a value-added modality to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is often used in diagnosis, treatment and progression monitoring, as well as in non-destructive, non-invasive studies of disease states in humans and model systems in animals. The availability of high magnetic field strengths and use of hyperpolarized nuclei, combined with the possibility of acquiring spectra at very short echo-time, have dramatically increased the potential of MRS. For the last two decades, a challenge has been to quantify short echo-time proton spectra that exhibit many metabolites, and to estimate their concentrations. Quantification of such spectra is challenging. Because the model function describing the acquired MRS signal is incomplete, semi-parametric techniques are required for estimation of the wanted metabolite concentrations. The semi-parametric approaches, QUEST, AQSES, TARQUIN, LCModel and SiToolsFITT, are reviewed and discussed according to handling of macromolecule signal and unknown decay of the metabolite signal (lineshape). Estimation of noise-related errors on model parameters and compromise used in real-world applications are detailed, with emphasis on the bias-variance trade-off. Applications of the semi-parametric methods QUEST and AQSES to quantification of MRS, HRMAS and MRSI data are also provided. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESMRMB.},

abstract = {? 2017 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor {\&} Francis ? 2017, ? David C. Woods, Antony M. Overstall, Maria Adamou, and Timothy W. Waite.The design of an experiment can always be considered at least implicitly Bayesian, with prior knowledge used informally to aid decisions such as the variables to be studied and the choice of a plausible relationship between the explanatory variables and measured responses. Bayesian methods allow uncertainty in these decisions to be incorporated into design selection through prior distributions that encapsulate information available from scientific knowledge or previous experimentation. Further, a design may be explicitly tailored to the aim of the experiment through a decision-theoretic approach using an appropriate loss function. We review the area of decision-theoretic Bayesian design, with particular emphasis on recent advances in computational methods. For many problems arising in industry and science, experiments result in a discrete response that is well described by a member of the class of generalized linear models. Bayesian design for such nonlinear models is often seen as impractical as the expected loss is analytically intractable and numerical approximations are usually computationally expensive. We describe how Gaussian process emulation, commonly used in computer experiments, can play an important role in facilitating Bayesian design for realistic problems. A main focus is the combination of Gaussian process regression to approximate the expected loss with cyclic descent (coordinate exchange) optimization algorithms to allow optimal designs to be found for previously infeasible problems. We also present the first optimal design results for statistical models formed from dimensional analysis, a methodology widely employed in the engineering and physical sciences to produce parsimonious and interpretable models. Using the famous paper helicopter experiment, we show the potential for the combination of Bayesian design, generalized linear models, and dimensional analysis to produce small but informative experiments.},

abstract = {We study the interplay between rotating wave approximation and optimal control. In particular, we show that for a wide class of optimal control problems one can choose the control field such that the Hamiltonian becomes time-independent under the rotating wave approximation. Thus, we show how to recast the functional minimization defined by the optimal control problem into a simpler multi-variable function minimization. We provide the analytic solution to the state-to-state transfer of the paradigmatic two-level system and to the more general star configuration of an N -level system. We demonstrate numerically the usefulness of this approach in the more general class of connected acyclic N -level systems with random spectra. Finally, we use it to design a protocol to entangle Rydberg atoms in an experimentally relevant range of parameters. The Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) plays a ma-jor role to simplify the quantum mechanical description of laser driven systems in the low intensity regime: it takes into account only the co-rotating field with the system and it neglects the counter-rotating part [1, 2]. This approximation has been introduced for two level quantum systems, and then generalized for N -level sys-tems [3]. The deviations from this approximation for big intensities are well known and commonly described as Bloch-Siegert shifts, breaking the harmonicity of the sys-tem dynamics [4]. Finally, a more general description is given by Floquet theory that allows to treat periodically driven systems [5]. Developing error-free protocols for the manipulation of quantum systems – also along the development of quan-tum technologies but not strictly restrict to them – is one of the major challenges in contemporary research in atom and molecular physics [6]. During the last decades, an increasing contribution in such effort has come from the exploitation of Quantum Optimal Control (QOC), the search for an optimal control pulse to perform a given sys-tem manipulation [7]. Methods to solve QOC problems have been developed [8–10] and experiments have shown the great benefit from them, see e.g. [11–15]. We have now deep theoretical understanding of QOC, in particu-lar about the possibilities and hurdles to control quan-tum systems [16–18], and we even start to understand the complexity of QOC problems [19, 20]. Graph the-ory concepts have been exploited to attack a question that lies at the heart of controllability studies: given a Hamiltonian depending on some time dependent tunable control field, is it possible to dynamically connect every pair of arbitrary initial and final state, i.e. it is possi-ble to realize every possible state-to-state transfer? A widely used criterion to answer to this question is via dynamical Lie-Algebras [18], while here we make use of a different criterion based on graph theory: Turinici and Rabitz showed that if the graph corresponding to the control Hamiltonian is connected and the spacings of the eigenvalues of the uncontrolled part of the Hamiltonian are non-degenerate, then wave function controllability is guaranteed [17]. In this paper, we identify a significant class of QOC problems where the RWA is applicable and show that within this class QOC problems can be easily solved: the functional optimization can be recast into a multi-variable function minimization, thus simplifying the nu-merical efforts and improving the theoretical understand-ing of the process. For this purpose we employ concepts from graph theory to analyze the system dynamics in an easier and more practical picture [21]. This allows us to straightforwardly identify the cases where it is possi-ble to map the time-dependent Hamiltonian onto a time-independent one and to find the solution of the QOC problem. As a result of this analysis, we can show that in this class of QOC problems the lower bound for the number of independent control parameters necessary for a successful control of the system –introduced in a recent work– is saturated [19].},

The three lineshape models gave substantially different peak areas in an in vitro experiment, with the Voigt model having a much lower $\chi$2 (2.1 compared with 5.2 for the Lorentzian model and 6.2 for the Gaussian model). In a group of 10 healthy volunteers, fitting of 1H spectra from cerebral white matter gave significantly different peak areas between the methods.

abstract = {Aerobic exercise is a promising form of prevention for cognitive decline; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which exercise and fitness impacts the human brain. Several studies have postulated that increased regional brain volume and function are associated with aerobic fitness because of increased vascularization rather than increased neural tissue per se. We tested this position by examining the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the right frontal cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. NAA is a nervous system specific metabolite found predominantly in cell bodies of neurons. We reasoned that if aerobic fitness was predominantly influencing the vasculature of the brain, then NAA levels should not vary as a function of aerobic fitness. However, if aerobic fitness influences the number or viability of neurons, then higher aerobic fitness levelsmight be associated with greater concentrations of NAA. We examined NAA levels, aerobic fitness, and cognitive performance in 137 older adults without cognitive impairment. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we found that higher aerobic fitness levels offset an age-related decline inNAA. Furthermore, NAA mediated an association between fitness and backward digit span performance, suggesting that neuronal viability as measured by NAA is important in understanding fitness-related cognitive enhancement. Since NAA is found exclusively in neural tissue, our results indicate that the effect of fitness on the human brain extends beyond vascularization; aerobic fitness is associated with neuronal viability in the frontal cortex of older adults. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

However, there are still limitations due to the closed structures of most conventional RF coils. In this study, a time-harmonic target-field method was employed to design open multi-purpose coil (OMC) for multi-angle musculoskeletal MR imaging. The phantom imaging results suggested that the proposed OMC could achieve homogeneously distributed magnetic field and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 239.04 ± 0.83 in the region of interest (ROI). The maximum temperature in the heating hazard test was 16 °C lower than the standard regulation, which indicated the security of the designed OMC. Furthermore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OMC for musculoskeletal MR imaging, especially for multi-angle imaging, a healthy volunteer was examined for MR imaging of elbow, ankle and knee using OMC. The in vivo imaging results showed that the proposed OMC is effective for MR imaging of musculoskeletal tissues at different body parts, with satisfied B1 field homogeneity and SNR. Moreover, the open structure of the OMC could provide a large joint movement region. The proposed open multi-purpose coil is feasible for musculoskeletal MR imaging, and potentially, it is more suitable for the evaluation of musculoskeletal tissues under multi-angle conditions.},

abstract = {Localized 1H NMR spectra at TE = 12 ms were obtained from cerebral cortex of human subjects using ISIS with surface suppression. The 2.29-ppm resonance was assigned to C4 glutamate with contributions from C4 glutamine and GABA using in vivo spectral editing and comparison of chemical shift with pure compounds. The measured intensity ratio between the 2.29 resonance and the creatine resonance at 3.03 ppm was in good agreement with the ratio predicted from previously reported measurements of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA concentrations in biopsied human brain tissue.},

@article{DeBrouwer2009,
abstract = {In our attempt to fully automate the data acquisition and processing of NMR analysis of dissolved synthetic polymers, phase correction was found to be the most challenging aspect. Several approaches in literature were evaluated but none of these was found to be capable of phasing NMR spectra with sufficient robustness and high enough accuracy to fully eliminate intervention by a human operator. Step by step, aspects from the process of manual/visual phase correction were translated into mathematical concepts and evaluated. This included area minimization, peak height maximization, negative peak minimization and baseline correction. It was found that not one single approach would lead to acceptable results but that a combination of aspects was required, in line again with the process of manual phase correction. The combination of baseline correction, area minimization and negative area penalization was found to give the desired results. The robustness was found to be 100{\%} which means that the correct zeroth order and first order phasing parameters are returned independent of the position of the starting point of the search in this parameter space. When applied to high signal-to-noise proton spectra, the accuracy was such that the returned phasing parameters were within a distance of 0.1-0.4 degrees in the two dimensional parameter space which resulted in an average error of 0.1{\%} in calculated properties such as copolymer composition and end groups. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Hager2005,
abstract = {A new nonlinear conjugate gradientmethod and an associated implementation, based on an inexact line search, are proposed and analyzed. With exact line search, our method reduces to a nonlinear version of the Hestenes–Stiefel conjugate gradient scheme. For any (inexact) line search, our scheme satisfies the descent condition g{\_}k d{\_}k {\textless}= -7/8||g{\_}k||{\^{}}2. Moreover, a global convergence result is established when the line search fulfills the Wolfe conditions. A new line search scheme is developed that is efficient and highly accurate. Efficiency is achieved by exploiting properties of linear interpolants in a neighborhood of a local minimizer. High accuracy is achieved by using a convergence criterion, which we call the “approximate Wolfe” conditions, obtained by replacing the sufficient decrease criterion in theWolfe conditions with an approximation that can be evaluated with greater precision in a neighborhood of a local minimum than the usual sufficient decrease criterion. Numerical comparisons are given with both L-BFGS and conjugate gradient methods using the unconstrained optimization problems in the CUTE library.},

@article{Aggarwal2017,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Preoperative tumour grading is imperative owing to difference in invasive, aggressive tendencies of different grades of glial tumours implying varied prognosis, therapeutic options. Histopathological examination has inherent sampling errors. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) can provide non invasive information about internal mileu hence, aiding in tumour grading by adding to information provided by conventional MRI sequences. AIM: To evaluate the role of multivoxel intermediate TE 2D CSI MRS and 2D echoplanar diffusion imaging in grading of primary glial brain tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in Department of Radiology, Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College and Research Centre, Uttar Pradesh, India, from April 2015 to August 2016 after obtaining necessary approvals from Institutional Ethical Committee and written informed consent from all participants on histopathological proven cases of glial brain tumours that underwent multivoxel MRS using intermediate TE 2D chemical shift imaging and DWI using 2D echoplanar imaging. Tumour grade calculated on MRI using MRS and DWI was compared with histopathological grading. Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for each parameter and statistical significance was evaluated using two tailed Pearson test. RESULTS: Choline: N Acetyl aspartate (Cho: NAA) and Choline: creatinine (Cho: Cr) ratios from MRS as well as Apparent Diffusion Coffecient (ADC) values from DWI were significantly higher with increasing severity of tumour grade. Accuracy of 58.6{\%} was obtained with DWI while it was 83{\%} with MRS. MRS and DWI used together provided 88.4{\%} accuracy. All parameters evaluated showed statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Both DWI as well as MRS were found to have statistically significant roles in grading of glial brain tumours. MRS was found to be more useful than DWI.},

@article{Prost1997,
abstract = {Midfield proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a noninvasive method to monitor glutamate and glutamine (Glx) levels in vivo. Experiments to detect the gamma and beta resonances of Glx have been performed by using commercial 0.5 T and 1.5 T MR scanners on seven patients with elevated blood ammonia and eight normal volunteers. Compared with the spectral sensitivity obtained on an otherwise identical system operating at 1.5 T, the singlet resonance of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) was decreased by a factor of 1.48, which is significantly less than expected using the ratio of Boltzman populations at the two field strengths. However, the resonances of Glx at 0.5 T increased in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a factor of 2. The increased SNR of Glx is principally due to improved B0 main-field homogeneity and collapse of the strongly J-coupled Glx resonances. Our preliminary results suggest that midfield proton MRS will provide significant clinical utility in the detection of Glx levels in human brain.},
