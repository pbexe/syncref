				<p>We present here an approach of characterizing polygamy of quantum correlations without the traditional polygamy inequalities. It can induce the standard polygamy inequalities for any continuous measure of quantum correlation with the polygamy power. We show that any faithful entanglement measure is not polygamous and any entanglement of assistance is polygamous but not monogamous. Monogamy law of quantum correlations as one of the most striking features in quantum world has been explored ever since the distribution of three qubit state en-tanglement discovered by Coffman, Kundu, and Woot-ters (CKW) [1-32]. A monogamy relation is quantitatively displayed as an inequality of the following form: Q(A|BC) ≥ Q(A|B) + Q(A|C) , (1) where Q is a measure of bipartite quantum correlation and A, B, C are three subsystems of a composite quantum system. Dually, the polygamy relation in literature is expressed as Q(A|BC) ≤ Q(A|B) + Q(A|C). (2) However, Eq. (1) [resp. Eq. (2)] captures only partially the property that Q is monogamous (resp. polygamous). For example, it is well known that if Q does not satisfy these relations, it is still possible to find a positive power α ∈ R + , such that Q α satisfies the relation. It was shown that many other measures of entanglement satisfy the monogamy relation (1) or polygamy relation (2) if Q is replaced by Q α for some α &gt; 1 [1-11]. Very recently, we introduced a definition of monogamy without inequalities in [33], which capture the nature of monogamy relation completely. In this paper we present a condition of polygamy without inequalities as in Eq. (2). Our definition of polygamy (see Definition 1 below) does not present as a polygamy relation. But, as what we will show, our definition is consistent with the traditional notion of polygamy, by showing that Q is polygamous according to our definition if and only if there exists an β &gt; 0 such that Q β satisfy (2). Consequently , any entanglement of assistance is monogamous according to our definition. We also prove that any faithful entanglement measure (a measure is said to be faithful if it is zero only on separable states) is not polygamy and any entanglement of assistance is not monogamous. Throughout this paper, a measure of quantum correlation Q refers to any quantity that characterizes the &quot;quantumness&quot; contained in bipartite quantum systems , such as entanglement, quantum discord [34, 35], measurement-induced nonlocality [36], quantum * Electronic address: guoyu3@aliyun.com deficit [37], and other quantum correlations introduce recent years [38-43], etc. We denote by S(H ABC) ≡ S ABC the set of density matrices acting on a tripartite Hilbert space H A ⊗ H B ⊗ H C ≡ H ABC associated with some tripartite system. For ρ ABC ∈ S ABC , ρ AB ≡ Tr C ρ ABC and ρ AC ≡ Tr B ρ ABC denote the marginal states on H AB and H AC , respectively. Definition 1. Let Q be a measure of quantum correlation. We call Q is polygamous if for any ρ ABC ∈ S ABC that satisfies Q(ρ A|BC) &gt; max{Q(ρ AB), Q(ρ AC)} &gt; 0 , (3) we have min{Q(ρ AB), Q(ρ AC)} &gt; 0. Definition 1 does not involve the standard polygamy relation as (2). However, we can derive a more quantitative inequality from (3): Theorem 1. Let Q be a continuous measure of quantum correlation. Then, Q is pologamous according to Definition 1 if and only if there exists 0 &lt; β &lt; ∞ such that Q β (ρ A|BC) ≤ Q β (ρ AB) + Q β (ρ AC) (4) holds for any ρ ABC ∈ S ABC with fixed dim H ABC = d &lt; ∞.</p>
